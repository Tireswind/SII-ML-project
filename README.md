# SII-ML-project
Fake News Detection for SII-ML University (Roma Tre) project.

This repository stores a Machine Learning and Intelligent Internet Systems project made by Alessandra Flaccavento, Computer Science Engineering student at Universit√† degli Studi di RomaTre and Software Engineer for Lutech S.p.A.. 

The purpose of the project was the classification and detection of fake news through standard Machine Learning approaches and classifiers, such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Stochastic Gradient Descent.

The process is implemented in Python and its libraries.

The output of the computations was then visualized through WordCloud.
