Masculinity is strongly tied to earning an income and avoiding things that are considered feminine.

Perhaps young families are open to women\u2019s equality outside the home because they need a second income, they said, but their attitudes about gender roles haven\u2019t actually evolved as much.\n\nOr, they might want a parent at home with young children because they embrace intensive parenting.

That could explain why men\u2019s time doing child care has increased more than their time doing housework, the researchers said.\n\nTheir study, which was published in the journal Sociological Science, was based on a national survey called Monitoring the Future, administered each year to high school seniors. The researchers analyzed data from 1976 to 2014, including 75,573 12th graders, between 2,000 and 4,000 a year. They focused on a question asking respondents to imagine a future in which they were married (it assumed to someone of the opposite sex) with children of preschool age, and to rate various work and child care arrangements.\n\nAcross all survey years, the largest share of respondents said the most desirable arrangement was men working full time and women staying home.

Self-control is a myth anyway, so just don\u2019t bother with it.\n\nThere are many ways to do this, all of which you can do right after reading this: increase your 401(k) contributions by a percentage point today; have your workplace split your paycheck among separate savings accounts; have your investment accounts make automatic withdrawals the day your paycheck hits your account; increase your automatic contribution to your Health Savings Account; or set up or increase recurring transfers from your checking account to your savings account.\n\nWhatever your savings needs are, the point is to make them automatic. Again, you can\u2019t miss (or spend) what was never there.

It will spend the next seven years spiraling inward to the center of the solar system. The Parker probe will be the first spacecraft to touch our star. Or any star. It will brush through the halo of hot gases that form the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere: the corona. The surface of the sun looks placid to our eyes, but it is pierced and roiled by strong magnetic fields. The fields trap gas blowing off the Sun and lift it into glowing arcs and streamers. Scientists don\u2019t understand how the corona works, or why it\u2019s hundreds of times hotter than the surface of the sun. The Parker probe will pass closer to the Sun than any mission before it. To get that close, the spacecraft will make seven flybys of Venus over seven years, gradually tightening its elliptical orbit and shifting it closer and closer to the sun. A high-tech heat shield will protect the probe from the punishing radiation and heat of the corona. Within the shield\u2019s shadow, the spacecraft instruments will operate at a comfortable room temperature. As the probe passes close to the sun, it will briefly become the fastest machine ever built by humans, zipping along at a brisk 430,000 miles per hour. The Parker probe is the first NASA spacecraft to be named after a living person. Eugene Parker is an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. In 1958, he suggested that the sun radiates a constant and intense stream of charged particles. He called it the solar wind. This wind pushes out comet tails and makes the long streamers seen in solar eclipses. With the Parker Solar Probe, scientists hope to learn more about the sun\u2019s turbulent corona. How it accelerates particles, and how it flings huge clouds of fiery gas outward across space. Huge waves of magnetized gas are called coronal mass ejections. If Earth gets in the way of one of these storms, it could be bad news. Our planet is protected by its own magnetic field, but a direct hit from one of these galloping clouds of particles and radiation could disrupt satellites and force astronauts in the space station to take shelter. In 1859, a powerful storm called the Carrington Event produced auroras as far south as Cuba. A solar storm of that size today could cripple satellites and power grids around the world. If successful, the Parker probe\u2019s mission to touch the sun may explain how solar storms form. Scientists hope it might teach us how to predict coronal outbursts more accurately and learn how to endure them.

It seems to be the remnant of a foot that once had five full toes, with only three remaining visible \u2014 two vestigial digits are still on either side of the large, hardened middle digit, but there is no trace of the others. The hoof has been held up as a sterling example of the idea that if something isn\u2019t working for a creature, it may be shed completely, with an excess toe or two left on the cutting room floor of evolution.\n\nBut when Kathryn Kavanagh, a biologist at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, was sorting through preserved horse embryos recently, she saw something that at first she couldn\u2019t quite believe. In the very early days of gestation, in the area of the foot where the hoof eventually forms, Dr. Kavanagh counted clusters of developing cells representing toes. And there were not three \u2014 there were unmistakably five.\n\nThe missing toes had in fact never left the horse, Dr. Kavanagh, Scott Bailey and Karen Sears report in a paper published Wednesday in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The finding suggests that certain stages of development cannot be changed, even if, in the adult animal, they leave no visible trace.\n\nThe window of time when all five toes were visible was very short. Because it can be difficult for scientists to obtain large numbers of horse embryos at different stages to study, it is possible that scientists who earlier studied horse anatomy assumed that horses had at most three toes because they didn\u2019t get the glimpse Dr. Kavanagh did.", "author": ["Veronique Greenwood"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/science/boeing-starliner-nasa.html?emc=rss&partner=rss", "published": "2020-02-07T22:33:50", "title": "Boeing Starliner Flight\u2019s Flaws Show \u2018Fundamental Problem,\u2019 NASA Says", "text": "An uncrewed test flight of a Boeing spacecraft designed to carry NASA astronauts may have narrowly avoided catastrophic failure in December.

It will spend the next seven years spiraling inward to the center of the solar system. The Parker probe will be the first spacecraft to touch our star. Or any star. It will brush through the halo of hot gases that form the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere: the corona. The surface of the sun looks placid to our eyes, but it is pierced and roiled by strong magnetic fields. The fields trap gas blowing off the Sun and lift it into glowing arcs and streamers. Scientists don\u2019t understand how the corona works, or why it\u2019s hundreds of times hotter than the surface of the sun. The Parker probe will pass closer to the Sun than any mission before it. To get that close, the spacecraft will make seven flybys of Venus over seven years, gradually tightening its elliptical orbit and shifting it closer and closer to the sun. A high-tech heat shield will protect the probe from the punishing radiation and heat of the corona. Within the shield\u2019s shadow, the spacecraft instruments will operate at a comfortable room temperature. As the probe passes close to the sun, it will briefly become the fastest machine ever built by humans, zipping along at a brisk 430,000 miles per hour. The Parker probe is the first NASA spacecraft to be named after a living person. Eugene Parker is an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. In 1958, he suggested that the sun radiates a constant and intense stream of charged particles. He called it the solar wind. This wind pushes out comet tails and makes the long streamers seen in solar eclipses. With the Parker Solar Probe, scientists hope to learn more about the sun\u2019s turbulent corona. How it accelerates particles, and how it flings huge clouds of fiery gas outward across space. Huge waves of magnetized gas are called coronal mass ejections. If Earth gets in the way of one of these storms, it could be bad news. Our planet is protected by its own magnetic field, but a direct hit from one of these galloping clouds of particles and radiation could disrupt satellites and force astronauts in the space station to take shelter. In 1859, a powerful storm called the Carrington Event produced auroras as far south as Cuba. A solar storm of that size today could cripple satellites and power grids around the world. If successful, the Parker probe\u2019s mission to touch the sun may explain how solar storms form. Scientists hope it might teach us how to predict coronal outbursts more accurately and learn how to endure them.

And one of the police departments had sent along this memo about a private company that was offering a radical new tool to solve crimes using facial recognition.\n\nannie brown\n\nAnd what would make a facial recognition tool radical?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo law enforcement has for years had access to facial recognition tools. But what this company was offering was unlike any other facial recognition tools that police have been using, because they had scraped the open web of public photos \u2014 from Facebook, from Venmo, from Twitter, from education sites, employment sites \u2014 and had a massive database of billions of photos. So the pitch is that you can take a picture of a criminal suspect, put their face into this app and identify them in seconds.\n\nannie brown\n\nAnd when you read this memo, what do you make of what this company is offering?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo I\u2019ve been covering privacy for 10 years, and I know that a technology like this in public hands is the nightmare scenario.\n\n[music]\n\nThis has been a tool that was too taboo for Silicon Valley giants who were capable of building it. Google in 2011 said that they could release a tool like this, but it was the one technology they were holding back because it could be used in a very bad way.\n\nannie brown\n\nAnd why exactly is this kind of technology this line in the sand that no one will cross? What makes it so dangerous?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo imagine this technology in public hands. It would mean that if you were at a bar and someone saw you and was interested in you, they could take your photo, run your face through the app, and then it pulls up all these photos of you from the internet. It probably takes them back to your Facebook page. So now they know your name, they know who you\u2019re friends with, they can Google your name, they can see where you live, where you work, maybe how much money you make. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a parent and you\u2019re walking down the street with your three-year-old. Somebody can take a photo of you and know where the two of you live. Imagine you\u2019re a protester in the U.S. or in a more authoritarian regime. All of a sudden they know everything about you, and you can face repercussions for just trying to exercise your political opinions. If this app were made publicly available, it would be the end of being anonymous in public. You would have to assume anyone can know who you are any time they\u2019re able to take a photo of your face.\n\nannie brown\n\nAnd so that technology is what this company is pitching these police departments?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nExactly.\n\nannie brown\n\nAnd what do you know about this company at this point?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo at this point, all I really know is that the company is called Clearview AI. And so the first thing I do is Google it. And I find their website, which is clearview.ai. And the website is pretty bare, but there\u2019s also an office address listed there, 145 West 41st Street, which happens to be just a couple of blocks from The New York Times office.\n\nannie brown\n\nRight.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo I decided to walk over there, and there just is no 145 West 41st Street. So that was weird. So now I have this company that\u2019s offering this radical new tool \u2014\n\nannie brown\n\nIt\u2019s got a fake address.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nIt\u2019s got a fake address, which is a huge red flag.\n\nannie brown\n\nSo what you do next?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nI found the company on LinkedIn. It only had one employee listed, a sales manager named John Good, which \u2014\n\nannie brown\n\nJohn Good.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nJohn Good. It seemed like it could also be fake. And I sent that person a LinkedIn message and never heard back. So one of the things I find online is a website called PitchBook that lists investments in start-ups. And so it says that this Clearview AI has received $7 million from a venture capital firm and from Peter Thiel \u2014 you know, a big name in Silicon Valley, invested in Facebook and Palantir. So I reach out to his spokesperson, and he says I\u2019ll get back to you. I never hear from him again. And then one day, I open up Facebook, and I have a message from a friend whose name I don\u2019t recognize. And he says, hey, I hear you\u2019re looking into Clearview AI. I know them. They\u2019re a great company. How can I help?\n\nannie brown\n\nAnd you don\u2019t know who this guy is?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nI don\u2019t. I mean, it\u2019s a guy I met once 10 years ago. And somehow he knows that I\u2019m looking into this company. But I\u2019ll take it. You know, finally \u2014\n\nannie brown\n\nRight!\n\nkashmir hill\n\n\u2014 somebody wants to talk to me about Clearview AI. And so I say, hey, can I give you a call? And then he doesn\u2019t respond, which I\u2019m getting used to.\n\nannie brown\n\nYou just can\u2019t catch a break.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nI know. I\u2019m like, I cannot believe this is another dead end. So phone and email are not working for me. So I just need to figure out another door to knock on to try to talk to a real human being. And one of the investors in the company is this venture capital firm that has an office in Bronxville, New York. So on a cold, rainy Tuesday, I got on the train and headed to Bronxville. I get to the company\u2019s address. It\u2019s just like in a retail space. And go inside. There\u2019s this long, quiet hallway of office suites, and this venture capital firm is at the very end. And I knock on the door, and there\u2019s no one there. So I start trying to talk to their neighbors, and a woman who works next door says, oh yeah, they\u2019re never here. So I\u2019m walking down the stairs to go back out of the building, and two guys walk through the door. They\u2019re both in dark suits with lavender and pink shirts underneath, and they just kind of look like V.C.s to me. So I say, hey, are you with this venture capital firm? And they say, we are. Who are you? And I was like, I\u2019m the New York Times reporter who\u2019s been trying to get in touch with you. And they said, the company has told us not to talk to you. And I said, well I\u2019ve come all the way out to Bronxville. Can we just chat for a little bit? And they say, O.K. If probably helps that I\u2019m very pregnant, and they offered me water. And they just start telling me everything.\n\n[music]\n\nannie brown\n\nAnd what do they tell you?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nThey confirm that they\u2019ve invested in Clearview AI and that Peter Thiel has also invested. They identified the genius coder behind the company, this guy named Hoan Ton-That. And they say he\u2019s Vietnamese royalty but he\u2019s from Australia. And they also tell me that Hoan is the one that was using the fake name John Good on LinkedIn.\n\nannie brown\n\nHe\u2019s John Good.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nHe\u2019s John Good. And they confirm that law enforcement is already using the app. And that law enforcement loves it and that it\u2019s spreading like wildfire.\n\nannie brown\n\nWow.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo I\u2019ve learned some stuff from these two investors, but no one from the company is talking to me still. So in the meantime, I am also reaching out to law enforcement, because I want to know if this app really works as well as the company claims. By this point, I had learned that over 600 law enforcement agencies had tried the app, including the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I.\n\nannie brown\n\nWow. It\u2019s not just local police departments. This is being used by the federal government already.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nYeah, I mean, I was just shocked to discover how easily government agencies can just try a new technology without apparently knowing much about the company that provides it. So I talked to a retired police chief from Indiana, who was actually one of the first departments to use the app. And they solved a case within 20 seconds, he said.\n\nannie brown\n\nA case they hadn\u2019t been able to solve?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nThat they hadn\u2019t been able to solve. One of the officers told me that he went back through like 30 dead-end cases that hadn\u2019t had any hits on the government database, and he got a bunch of hits using the app. So they were really excited about it.\n\nannie brown\n\nThis is way more effective than what they were using before.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nExactly. With the government databases they were previously using, they had to have a photo that was just a direct full-face photo of a suspect \u2014 like mug shots and driver\u2019s license photos. But with Clearview, it could be a person wearing glasses, or a hat, or part of their face was covered, or they were in profile, and officers were still getting results on these photos.\n\nannie brown\n\nWow.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nBut the most astounding story I was told was that investigators had this child exploitation video, and there was an adult who was visible in the video just for a few seconds in the background. So they had this person\u2019s face. They had run it through their usual databases and not gotten anything back. But then they ran his face through Clearview\u2019s app, and he turned up in the background of someone else\u2019s gym selfie. You could see his face in the mirror. And so they figured out what gym this photo was taken out. They went to the gym. They asked the employees, do you know who this is? And the employee said, we can\u2019t tell you. We have to protect our members\u2019 privacy. But then later, the detectives got a text from somebody who worked there identifying the person. And that \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s just something that would not have been possible without Clearview\u2019s app. So because officers were telling me the tool works so well, I wanted to see it for myself, on myself. And I asked them if they would run my photo through the app. But every time I did this, things would get weird. The officers would tell me that they ran my photo and there were no results.\n\nannie brown\n\nNo pictures of you?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nThere were no pictures of me, which was really weird, because I have a lot of photos of myself online. And then officers would just stop responding to me or talking to me. And I had no idea what was going on until one officer was kind enough to explain to me.\n\n[phone ringing] officer Hello, how are you. kashmir hill Hey. It\u2019s Kashmir. officer Yes, hi. Mm-hmm.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nI\u2019m keeping this officer anonymous because he could get in serious trouble for talking to me so openly about Clearview.\n\nkashmir hill If you could just describe yourself, to the extent that you can describe yourself. officer I\u2019m a police officer at a large metropolitan police department.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo he\u2019s a cop who was doing a 30-day free trial of the app. And he was really impressed with it. So I asked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind running my photo.\n\nannie brown\n\nAnd what did he tell you happened when he sent your picture through?\n\nofficer Yeah, nothing. I didn\u2019t get a response at all. kashmir hill No results? officer No results. And within a couple of minutes of me putting your photo up there \u2014 maybe five, less than 10 \u2014 I got a phone call from the Clearview company. They wanted to know why I was uploading a New York Times reporter\u2019s photo. kashmir hill That is so wild. I don\u2019t know. [LAUGHS] It creeps me out as a reporter. I mean yeah, it just \u2014 officer It kind of creeped me out as a user.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo this implied that Clearview flagged my face in their system such that they got an alert when a police officer ran my face. Which I found \u2014\n\nannie brown\n\nWow.\n\nkashmir hill\n\n\u2014 very alarming, because this is telling me for the first time that this company is able to monitor who law enforcement is looking for, and not just know who they\u2019re looking for, but manipulate the results. And so then that made me go back to the earlier officers who had run my photo. And they all confirmed, yes, I got a call from the company, and they said, we\u2019re not supposed to be talking to the media.\n\n[music]\n\nkashmir hill So were you able to keep using the app after that? officer My account was deactivated. kashmir hill Did you ever get access back? officer I never did. But I have colleagues that have access. So if I were to need a picture searched, I could just email it to them and they can email me the results. kashmir hill And you think the trade-offs are worth it, in terms of what the company has access to? officer Do I think it\u2019s worth it? So from a law enforcement perspective, it\u2019s worth it. We get a lot of cases, and we don\u2019t usually have a lot of leads. And so anything that can \u2014 honestly, anything that can help us solve a crime is a win for us. From a privacy perspective, it\u2019s rather frightening the amount of information that they were able to get and provide. As long as they\u2019re doing it for the right reasons, then everything will work out. Let\u2019s put it that way.\n\n[music]\n\nkashmir hill\n\nBut the problem is we don\u2019t know anything about the company at this point. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any kind of oversight. We don\u2019t know who the people are that are operating this and what their intentions are with their product. The person in charge of the company won\u2019t talk to me. But then, it\u2019s the end of December when I get a call from the company\u2019s spokeswoman. And she says that the founder, Hoan Ton-That, is ready to talk.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\n\nkashmir hill Do you have a hard stop? hoan ton-that No I don\u2019t actually. 12:30. lisa linden 12:00 noon. hoan ton-that Oh, 12:00 noon. kashmir hill I have no hard stop. lisa linden Oh. kashmir hill And I have lots of questions, so I\u2019ll take as much time as you can give me.\n\nannie brown\n\nSo Kashmir, you finally got an interview with the founder of Clearview, this man named Hoan Ton-That. Where do you meet him?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo we met in a WeWork in Chelsea. He came down to the lobby.\n\nkashmir hill You like New York, you\u2019re going to stay here? hoan ton-that Oh, yeah.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nAnd his appearance surprised me, because I had Googled him online and there are a lot of photos of him. And he\u2019s usually pretty eccentric \u2014 like a lot of paisley shirts, he\u2019s at Burning Man.\n\nhoan ton-that Let\u2019s go to the back room.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nBut in person he was very conservative. He was in this dark blue navy suit with a white button-up and leather shoes. So he looked very much like the security start-up entrepreneur.\n\nannie brown\n\nHe was looking the part.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nHe was looking the part.\n\nkashmir hill When were you born? How old are you? hoan ton-that \u201888, so I\u2019m 31. kashmir hill O.K.\n\nannie brown\n\nAnd what do you learn about him?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo he is 31. He grew up in Australia, but you can\u2019t hear that in his voice.\n\nhoan ton-that I love computers, obviously. kashmir hill Yeah, so how did you get interested in technology? hoan ton-that We had a computer, of course, when I was four or five years old.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo his family got a computer when he was three or four, and he was always tinkering with computers growing up.\n\nhoan ton-that We got the internet when I was 10, I think. And then you could discover all these things online. But Linux, I was like I have to get this thing. It\u2019s the nerdiest thing ever. I convinced my dad. We installed it, and I would spend the whole summer reinstalling and learning Linux stuff, staying home from high school and learning programming for fun. So that\u2019s \u2014 I just really liked it.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nHe enrolled in college, decided to drop out like many technologists do, and moved to San Francisco when he was 19.\n\nhoan ton-that \u2014 2007, before it was a big thing, right? It was kind of getting there, but it wasn\u2019t huge.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nThis is 2007, and this is kind of a boom time. The iPhone has just come out.\n\nhoan ton-that That\u2019s the Facebook app era. Remember that? kashmir hill Yeah.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nPeople are becoming millionaires by making Facebook games. And he wants to be the next big app guy.\n\nhoan ton-that Being there is a lot different from reading about it online. You absorb a lot more of how people get things done. And you learn a lot more secrets.\n\nannie brown\n\nWhat did he built?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo the Facebook apps were like \u201cwould you rather\u201d apps and kind of like romantic GIFs.\n\nhoan ton-that Did Some of the first iPhone games as well.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nOne of his most recent apps was called Trump Hair, and it was an app for adding Trump\u2019s hair to your photos.\n\nannie brown\n\nThat\u2019s it?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nThat\u2019s it. The tagline was, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be yuge!\u201d\n\nannie brown\n\nO.K. [LAUGHS] So how do you move from a Donald Trump hair app to something that seems like it could revolutionize police work?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nWell, he moved to New York. And that seemed to be a big change for him. And he started meeting very different people. And one of the most important people he met was Richard Schwartz.\n\nhoan ton-that I ended up meeting Richard at a party.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nThis 61-year-old guy who worked for Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the 1990s. He was just very politically connected.\n\nhoan ton-that I really loved that. He had a lot of stories. And then we talked for an hour about different ideas. Because I was like, this is what I do \u2014 technology. I can make anything. And it went from there.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nAnd the two of them decided, with Hoan Ton-That\u2019s tech know-how and Richard\u2019s Rolodex, that they want to try to start a facial recognition company together.\n\nannie brown\n\nAnd why facial recognition? Why did the two of them choose that?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nI think it was because Hoan had started reading a lot of papers about facial recognition and machine learning.\n\nhoan ton-that I had never really studied AI stuff before, but I could pick up a lot of it.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nAnd I think they realized they could make money doing it.\n\nkashmir hill What would you say, in terms of the range of ideas at first, what were you thinking? hoan ton-that A lot. I could go on, really crazy, but \u2014\n\nkashmir hill\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of face recognition algorithms out there, and a lot that work pretty well. What was different about what Hoan Ton-That and Richard Schwartz were doing is they had been willing to scrape all of these photos from the internet. So they just had a huge database of photos.\n\nannie brown\n\nRight, the billions of photos.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nExactly.\n\nhoan ton-that And then we had this point where we got to 99 percent accuracy. I remember that, it was just in the office. And he was like, wow, it works. Try that one again. Try that one again. And just every time, it would pick the right person out. And that\u2019s when we knew, this is crazy. This actually works.\n\nannie brown\n\nIs that legal? Can you just take photographs from anywhere on the internet and use them for this kind of thing?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nThere was a ruling in a federal court this fall that said, yeah, this kind of public scraping seems to be legal.\n\nannie brown\n\nAnd what are they hoping to do with this software at this point?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nI mean, they\u2019re just trying to figure out how they can make money off of the app. And so they eventually end up settling on law enforcement.\n\nhoan ton-that And they start solving cases from grainy A.T.M. photos, cases they would\u2019ve never solved. So this spread to different departments, and then from one agency to other agencies.\n\nannie brown\n\nAnd do you ask him about that thing that happened with the officer who couldn\u2019t find your photos?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nYeah, so that was one of my questions, and I wasn\u2019t entirely satisfied by his answer.\n\nhoan ton-that So \u2014 kashmir hill One thing that surprised me \u2014 some of the officers I talked to tried to run my photo through it, and they got no hits. And I tons of photos online. hoan ton-that [LAUGHS] It must have been a bug. kashmir hill Did you guys block me from like getting results? hoan ton-that I don\u2019t know about that. kashmir hill Because I was like, this doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nHe said, oh yeah, that was a software bug. But he laughed.\n\nkashmir hill I was like, I have 1,000 photos online. This can\u2019t work as well as they say it works. hoan ton-that Yeah, well, it must have been a bug in the software or something. kashmir hill [LAUGHS] Why did you do that? It totally made me think that \u2014 hoan ton-that Hey, maybe it doesn\u2019t work. You never know, right? This could be the long con. kashmir hill Ah, O.K. hoan ton-that I\u2019m kidding, I\u2019m kidding. It works.\n\nannie brown\n\nWhat do you think that was about?\n\nkashmir hill\n\n[LAUGHS] I don\u2019t think it was a software bug.\n\nhoan ton-that It\u2019s a bug. I don\u2019t know. I \u2014 kashmir hill You have no idea, huh?\n\nannie brown\n\nHuh.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nYeah. So he said the software bug is now fixed.\n\nhoan ton-that Oh yes, so I\u2019ll show you. This is the iPhone version.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nAnd he took a photo of me.\n\nhoan ton-that Oh, it does work. kashmir hill Oh, that\u2019s so surprising. hoan ton-that I know.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nAnd there, the results included a bunch of photos of me online.\n\nkashmir hill Oh my god, I totally forgot. hoan ton-that Well, we can take \u2014 kashmir hill That\u2019s 10 years ago.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nIncluding some I had never seen before.\n\nkashmir hill Some of these photos I didn\u2019t know were online.\n\nannie brown\n\nSo he\u2019s just brushing off this weird thing that happened to you. But do you get the sense that he\u2019s thinking at all about privacy?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nSo I asked him, you know, this is a very powerful app. And I asked him what restrictions is he thinking about for it. And he said, one, that they were only selling it to law enforcement right now, though it does turn out that they\u2019re also selling it to a few private companies for security purposes. But he said they wouldn\u2019t sell it to bad actors or bad governments.\n\nhoan ton-that \u2014 and our philosophy is basically, if it\u2019s a U.S. based \u2014 or like a democracy or an ally of the U.S. \u2014 we will consider it. But like, no China, no Russia or anything that wouldn\u2019t be good. So if it\u2019s a country where it\u2019s just governed terribly or whatever, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d feel comfortable selling to certain countries.\n\nannie brown\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t sound like he has much of a rubric for deciding who to sell to. And it sounds like there\u2019s no one really overseeing how he\u2019s making these decisions.\n\nkashmir hill\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s just up to Clearview to decide who they want to sell the app to.\n\nhoan ton-that No pressure, but when we talk to some venture capitalists, they\u2019re like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make this consumer? Law enforcement is such a small market. You won\u2019t make that much money.\u201d And we\u2019ve considered it, and we\u2019re just like, what\u2019s the use case here? And right now, we catch, help catch pedophiles. What if a pedophile got access to this, goes around the street, runs \u2014\n\nkashmir hill\n\nBut when I was talking to one of their investors, he says, we want to dominate the law enforcement market, and then we want to move into other markets like hospitality, like real estate. And he predicted that one day, all consumers will have access to this app.\n\nhoan ton-that Um, and \u2014 kashmir hill I can tell you that one of your investors hopes that you guys are going to go into the consumer market. hoan ton-that Well, yeah. He talks too much. But like, we\u2019re not \u2014 we\u2019re not going to do that. I just don\u2019t \u2014\n\nannie brown\n\nHoan seems to be saying, yeah, there\u2019s pressure on us to sell to private consumers, but we\u2019re not going to do that. And how reasonable is it to think that he has control or the company has control at this point over where this technology goes?\n\nkashmir hill\n\nI mean, one point that I made when I was talking to him is that oftentimes, the tools that law enforcement use end up in the hands of the public.\n\nkashmir hill I just \u2014 I personally feel like you guys have opened the door to now this becoming more normalized, just because a lot of tools that law enforcement have eventually make their way into public hands. hoan ton-that Not always. Not everyone has a gun. [LAUGHS] Right? That would be \u2014 kashmir hill Anyone who wants one can get one in the U.S. basically, but \u2014\n\nkashmir hill\n\nHis response was strange. He said, well, look at guns. Law enforcement has guns, but not everybody has a gun. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because he\u2019s from Australia?\n\nannie brown\n\nYeah, he\u2019s proving your point, in a way.\n\nkashmir hill\n\n[LAUGHS] It did seem like he was proving my point, rather than rebutting it.\n\n[music]\n\nWe\u2019ve been building the technology to make this possible for years now. Facebook building this huge database of our photos with our names attached to it, advances in image recognition and search technologies, it all led us here. But there\u2019s been no accompanying regulation or rules around how the technology should be used. There\u2019s no real law or regulation that makes this illegal. The scraping seems to be O.K. We don\u2019t have a big ban on facial recognition. We don\u2019t need to give consent for people to process our faces. And so in terms of holding this tool back, we\u2019re just relying on the moral compasses of the companies that are making this technology and on the thoughtfulness of people like Hoan Tan-That.\n\nkashmir hill But yeah, what do you think about that?

But it\u2019s unclear what, if any, power those social media companies have to force Clearview to comply. A few weeks ago, the state of New Jersey barred law enforcement from using Clearview\u2019s technology, but police remain free to do so in 49 other states. We\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today. President Trump has begun a campaign of retribution against witnesses in the impeachment inquiry, firing Gordon Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, who called the president\u2019s actions toward Ukraine a quid pro quo. And Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a member of the National Security Council, who expressed alarm over the president\u2019s phone call with the leader of Ukraine. The Times reports that several Republican senators urged Trump not to fire the witnesses, fearing it would send a dangerous message, but that the president ignored their advice. And the global death toll from the coronavirus has reached more than 800, surpassing that of the SARS epidemic, which killed 774 in 2003. The number of confirmed infections from the coronavirus now stands at more than 37,000. Finally, new polling in New Hampshire, which will hold its primary tomorrow, shows Mayor Pete Buttigieg neck-and-neck with Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden slipping into fourth place.\n\narchived recording (george stephanopoulos) Vice President Biden, the first question is for you.

It was SpaceX\u2019s second batch of satellites, launched days earlier.\n\n\u201cIt was just incredible \u2014 watching one after the other after the other,\u201d Dr. Johnson said.\n\nAt the time, he was using the Blanco 4-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory to observe the outer edges of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds \u2014 two dwarf galaxies.

They also orbit at a much greater distance from Earth. And they are designed to be smaller with a rough surface that reflects less light. Those three characteristics make the satellites fainter than Starlink\u2019s, and invisible to the naked eye. That means the satellites won\u2019t obscure your view of the cosmos during a camping trip, as so many feared when Starlink was first deployed.\n\nBut any telescope will be able to see them.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 Nothing so well illustrates Wall Street\u2019s dangerously exuberant state of mind as its triple-digit rally in the wake of Larry Summers withdrawing from consideration to be the next Federal Reserve chairman.\n\nDo you really believe the outlook for corporate earnings suddenly became much brighter just because Summers is no longer in the running to succeed Ben Bernanke?\n\nIf so, I have a bridge I want to sell you.\n\nWall Street is now fully ensconced in that alternate reality in which all news is interpreted as a reason to rally. It\u2019s nice while it lasts, but it probably won\u2019t end well.\n\nIn fact, according to contrarian analysis, this sentiment situation is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the wall of worry that bull markets like to climb. It\u2019s more akin to the slope of hope that bear markets like to descend.\n\nConsider the bullishness that now prevails among the short-term market timing newsletters tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest. Their average recommended equity exposure right now stands at 56.6%, according to the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index (HSNSI). That\u2019s 45 percentage points higher than the exposure level that prevailed just 12 trading sessions ago, in late August.\n\nThat\u2019s an awfully quick jump back on the bullish bandwagon by the typical market timer. In fact, the HSNSI is now higher than where it stood at the market\u2019s all-time high in early August \u2014 right before the stock market\u2019s August pullback (see chart).\n\nThis is a textbook illustration of what happens when Wall Street adopts a \u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d attitude.\n\nIf the market really thought it would be so awful if Larry Summers were Fed chairman, then it should have fallen as it looked increasingly likely that he would be appointed. That would have especially been true this past Friday, following a report from Japan\u2019s Nikkei newspaper that President Obama had decided to appoint Summers.\n\nFar from falling, however, the market rose on Friday \u2014 both at the open, right after that story appeared on the wires, and for the rest of the day as well.\n\nIndeed, Friday\u2019s action led some analysts to complain Friday that the market had yet to price in what they referred to as the \u201cSummers put.\u201d Never mind, though, logic has nothing to do with this market: It still rallied on Monday as though it had priced in that put.\n\nThe same has been true recently for other potentially bad news, such as Syria. The market shrugs off the initial threat of that bad news, and yet its removal is taken as the occasion for rallying.\n\nThe contrarian-based worry about this sentiment situation is that the market is being held up more by a happy mood than by a solid assessment of the fundamentals. As a result, the market will fall all the more precipitously when investors\u2019 mood begins to sour \u2014 as it eventually will.\n\nAnd though investor psychology is difficult to analyze, we know investors are notoriously fickle. Will it be paralysis in Washington over the debt ceiling that causes them to become less exuberant? A worsening of the Syria mess? Most likely, it will be something that comes out of left field that isn\u2019t even on our radar right now.\n\nThe one thing we do know is that, when that souring does happen, the market\u2019s lofty level will not be receiving much support from the fundamentals.\n\nBuyer beware.\n\nClick here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/ayrWz1FSrQE/story.asp", "published": "2013-04-12T20:28:34", "title": "Picking a perfect dividend portfolio", "text": "CHAPEL HILL. N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 When it comes to dividends, more isn\u2019t always better: A company isn\u2019t necessarily more attractive just because it pays a higher dividend.\n\nThat is the clear lesson I draw from the dividend-oriented newsletter with the best long-term record among the 200 services in the Hulbert Financial Digest rankings: Investment Quality Trends, edited by Kelley Wright. \u201cHigher\u201d or \u201clower\u201d for him only have meaning when comparing a company\u2019s current dividend with what it paid in the past. He believes that comparisons with other companies are unhelpful.\n\nConsider CVS Caremark Corp. CVS, +0.82% , the drug retailer, and HCP Inc. US:HCP , the health-care real-estate investment trust. Wright rates CVS Caremark more highly than HCP, even though CVS\u2019s dividend yield \u2014 the annual dividend as a percentage of the stock price \u2014 is just 1.6%, while HCP has a 4.1% yield.\n\nWright believes CVS is the better bet because its current yield is at the high end of the range of its past yields, which have extended from a low of 0.4% to its current 1.6%. HCP\u2019s current yield, by contrast, is at the low end of its historical range, which has gotten as high as 12.4%. So, in terms of relative dividend yield, CVS\u2019s is higher than HCP\u2019s.\n\nOver the years, Wright has found that high yields come back down to earth and low yields rise back toward the midpoint of their historical range. That would be bad news for HCP, since a likely cause of its yield rising would be a falling stock price \u2014 which could lead to losses that more than eliminate the benefit of the high yield.\n\nFor CVS, by contrast, Wright believes the path of least resistance is for its yield to decline because its stock price rises.\n\nTo be sure, CVS\u2019s yield also would come down if the company cuts its dividend, which would be bad for its stock price. Wright therefore focuses his analysis only on companies with strong balance sheets and a long and consistent pattern of higher earnings and increasing dividends.\n\nSo how has Wright\u2019s strategy performed over time? According to the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s calculations, Investment Quality Trends over the past three decades has beaten the dividend-adjusted return of the entire U.S. stock market by an average of 1.2 percentage points a year \u2014 while nevertheless incurring less risk.\n\nThat is a winning combination: The service is in second place for risk-adjusted performance among the three dozen advisers for which track records extend back that far.\n\nWright\u2019s strategy is to be distinguished from the traditional approach to picking dividend stocks, which focuses on absolute rather than relative yield.\n\nOne popular variant of the traditional approach is the so-called Dogs of the Dow strategy, in which investors buy the 10 stocks among the 30 Dow Industrials DJIA, +0.00% with the highest yields. For example, the three Dow \u201cdogs\u201d that currently have the highest yields are two telecommunication companies, AT&T T, -0.44% (4.7%) and Verizon Communications VZ, -2.57% (4.1%), and tech giant Intel INTC, +1.54% (4.1%).\n\nDespite investing in stocks with yields this high, however, the strategy has disappointed recently. Over the past five years (through March 31), it has produced a 5.0% annualized return, lagging the 5.9% dividend-adjusted return of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.17% and barely half the 10.8% return of a portfolio that is periodically updated to always contain just the 10 stocks that Wright recommends most highly.\n\nAnother variant of the traditional focus on absolute yield can be found in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index. It contains the 50 highest-yielding stocks among the S&P 1500 Composite index that also have a long history of dividend increases.\n\nThe index\u2019s two largest components currently are Pitney Bowes (the mail and document-services company, with a 10.0% yield) and biotech company AbbVie (yielding 3.7%).\n\nThough the performance of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats index in recent years has been better than that of the Dogs of the Dow strategy, it still lags behind that of Investment Quality Trends. Over the past five years, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY, +0.32% , which is benchmarked to the index, has produced an annual dividend-adjusted return of 9.2% through March 31 \u2014 nearly two percentage points a year lower than the portfolio of Wright\u2019s 10 most attractive dividend stocks.\n\nNote carefully that this Wright portfolio currently holds none of the stocks that are at the top of the holdings list for either the Dogs of the Dow or the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. In addition to CVS Caremark, the following nine stocks are in Wright\u2019s portfolio: Air Products & Chemicals APD, +0.28% (yielding 3.3%), Archer Daniels Midland ADM, +0.97% (2.3%), Coca-Cola KO, -0.27% (2.7%), ConocoPhillips COP, +1.45% (4.4%), Occidental Petroleum OXY, +1.65% (3.2%), PepsiCo PEP, +0.29% (2.7%), Reliance Steel & Aluminum RS, +1.12% (1.7%), Texas Instruments TXN, +0.81% (3.1%) and Walgreen US:WAG (2.3%).\n\nThe average yield of all 10 stocks is 2.7%, versus 2.0% for the S&P 500 as a whole.

An adviser is deemed to be a \u201ctop performer\u201d if he jumps over two hurdles: First, he must in the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s ranking have beaten a buy-and-hold in the stock market over the last 15 years.

The two auto makers that garner any buy recommendations from the top performers don\u2019t come anywhere close to that kind of popularity: Currently there are 75 other stocks in addition to Pfizer that those top performers like more.\n\nNote carefully, furthermore, that there are no other auto makers besides these four that the top performers like any better.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 The most cited bullish argument these days, at least among the couple of hundred investment advisers I monitor, is that the stock market will \u201cmelt up\u201d as investors sour on bonds and transfer the trillions they have in fixed-income mutual funds into stock funds.\n\nI suppose it is conceivable. But a careful review of historical fund patterns doesn\u2019t provide much support for this so-called Great Rotation argument.\n\nConsider the share of all mutual-fund assets (excluding money-market funds) that are allocated to either stocks or bonds. According to data provided by the Investment Company Institute in Washington, the equity share at the end of 2012 stood at 65.7%. That is only marginally lower than the 71% average of all comparable monthly readings since 1970.\n\nGiven that pattern, it is difficult to make the case that average fund investors are allocating an abnormally low share of their assets to stocks \u2014 or that they are about to increase that share.\n\nOther mutual-fund data cast doubt on the Great Rotation as well.\n\nConsider 1987, arguably the period over the past three decades most relevant to the Great Rotation argument today. Then, as now, a bull market was getting long in the tooth. Beginning in April of that year, following more than 60 months in which fund investors had invested an average of nearly $4 billion a month of new money in bonds, they reversed course in a big way. Over the next six months, according to the ICI data, fund investors withdrew an average of $3 billion a month from bond funds.\n\nAs market historians recall, the stock market that year topped out in August, four months after that trend reversal. And the 1987 crash \u2014 the worst one-day drop in U.S. stock-market history \u2014 occurred two months after that. Far from inaugurating a new bull market for stocks, that reversal in fund investors\u2019 opinion about bonds came right before a major stock-market top.\n\nAnother reason to question the Great Rotation argument is that any positive impact on the stock market is likely to be short-term at best. That, at least, is the finding of a study, \u201cMeasuring Investment Sentiment with Mutual Fund Flows,\u201d published last May in the Journal of Financial Economics.\n\nThe authors found that even though the stock market often rises as investors shift assets from bond funds to stock funds, almost all of that increase is reversed within four months\u2019 time.\n\nThe Great Rotation stock-market melt-up hypothesis also would have to fly in the face of well-documented seasonal trading patterns. A study presented in December at the Australasian Finance & Banking Conference in Sydney, \u201cSeasonal Asset Allocation: Evidence from Mutual Fund Flows,\u201d found that U.S. fund investors on average transfer assets from stock to bond funds during the winter months \u2014 and do just the reverse in summer.\n\nAs followers of the famous \u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d seasonal pattern will recognize, the implication of this new research is that the stock market on balance has performed better when the direction of fund flows between stocks and bonds is in precisely the opposite direction of what\u2019s presumed by the Great Rotation argument.\n\nEven if a Great Rotation out of bonds comes to pass, it doesn\u2019t mean investors will move all of that money into stocks.\n\nIn fact, they probably would put much of it in boring old money-market funds, according to Claude Erb, a former fixed-income fund manager at Trust Co. of the West.\n\nInvestors are reluctant to transfer funds between one asset class and another, Erb says. Since they typically consider money-market funds to be in the fixed-income asset class, money funds most likely would be the primary beneficiary of bond-fund redemptions, he says \u2014 especially since the higher interest rates that make bond funds less attractive would make money funds more so.\n\nIf these patterns are any guide to the future, now might be the time to pull back from stocks rather than dive in. As Russ Wermers, a University of Maryland finance professor and one of the authors of the research presented at the December conference, puts it: \u201cFor most investors, the more proper response to the fund flow premise of the Great Rotation argument is probably to reduce equity exposure rather than allocate new sums to equities.\u201d", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/3FYsOI8GjSk/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-06T13:30:38", "title": "Insiders now aggressively bearish", "text": "Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 Corporate insiders are aggressively selling their shares.\n\nThis is worrisome because corporate insiders \u2014 officers, directors and the largest shareholders \u2014 presumably know more about their companies\u2019 prospects than the rest of us do. If they were confident that the shares of their companies would soon be trading markedly higher, they wouldn\u2019t be selling them now.\n\nYet selling they are \u2014 at an alarming pace.\n\nConsider an insider indicator calculated by the Vickers Weekly Insider Report, published by Argus Research. The indicator is a ratio of all shares that insiders have recently sold in the open market to the number that they have purchased.\n\nFor the week that ended last Friday, this sell-to-buy ratio for NYSE-listed shares listed stood at 9.20-to-1. That means insiders of these companies, on average, were selling more than nine shares of their firms\u2019 stock for every one that they were buying.\n\nThe last time a weekly sell-to-buy ratio was worse than this was in late July 2011, right before that year\u2019s debt-ceiling debate began to spiral out of control. Over the next couple of weeks, of course, as the U.S. Treasury\u2019s credit rating was downgraded, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.00% lost some 2,000 points.\n\nTo be sure, insiders have been selling heavily for several weeks now, and the market has continued to rise \u2014 including the Dow\u2019s eclipsing of the 14,000 level in recent sessions. This surprising strength in the face of insider selling has prompted a number of you to inquire how unusual it is for the insiders collectively to be such poor market timers.\n\nAs you can imagine, it\u2019s not unprecedented. But it is more the exception than the rule.\n\nConsider where the sell-to-buy ratio was in mid-December, which is the last time I devoted a column to the insiders\u2019 behavior. For NYSE-listed stocks, the ratio at that time stood at 8.38-to-1. Read Dec. 18 Mark Hulbert column on insider selling.\n\nUpon reviewing the historical data, shared with me by Argus Research, I found four occasions over the last decade in which the ratio got this high or higher and the market continued rising for at least another month or two.\n\nOverall, however, the market fell. On average over the month following each prior occasion when the sell-to-buy ratio got this high, the broad market fell by 2.1% \u2014 as measured by the Wilshire 5000 total-return index.\n\nIn any case, as others among you have pointed out, the high level of insider selling in December could very well have been caused in large part by the prospect of higher tax rates in 2013 \u2014 which would have prompted them to accelerate their sales. To the extent this was so, of course, the high sell-to-buy ratio at that time would have been a false signal.\n\nRegardless, the sell-to-buy ratio today is even higher than it was in mid-December, and it can\u2019t be discounted because of the immediate prospect of higher taxes.\n\nAll of which suggests to me that there is a distinct possibility that this time around, unlike in December, the insiders will be right.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/wPEX3LaXAsc/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-05T13:01:27", "title": "How to pick dividend-paying stocks", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 So you\u2019ve finally decided to heed the oft-repeated advice to invest in dividend-paying stocks.\n\nNow what?\n\nIt turns out that you still have an overwhelmingly large number of stocks to choose among. In 2012, for example, more than 400 of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.17% paid dividends \u2014 or more than 80% of them.\n\nTelling me to confine myself to just the dividend-payers, therefore, doesn\u2019t narrow my buy list down to a helpful number.\n\nThe best way of going about constructing a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks, based on the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s monitoring of more than 500 separate strategies, is to follow the methodology employed by Investment Quality Trends.\n\nThis service, inaugurated by Geraldine Weiss more than four decades ago and currently edited by Kelley Wright, doesn\u2019t simply recommend the dividend stocks with the highest yield. The service instead focuses more narrowly on the bluest of the blue-chip dividend-paying stocks, and recommends one of them only when its yield is near the high end of its historical range.\n\nThe service\u2019s restriction to just the bluest of blue-chip companies is designed to avoid companies at which the dividend yield is only temporarily high \u2014 firms that are about to cut their dividends, in other words.\n\nSpecifically, Wright puts a stock on his watch list only if it satisfies at least five of the following six criteria:\n\nHas increased its dividend at least 5 times over the last dozen years\n\nHas an S&P Quality Ranking in the \u201cA\u201d category\n\nHas at least 5 million shares outstanding\n\nHas at least 80 institutional investors\n\nHas paid dividends for at least 25 straight years\n\nHas produced higher earnings per share in at least 7 of the last 12 years\n\nThe service\u2019s focus on relative dividend yield is a recognition that each company has a different baseline. A utility company, for example, may still pay a much higher dividend yield than other companies, even when that yield is lower than its baseline \u2014 and when, therefore, it more likely than not is overvalued.\n\nHow has this approach performed? Over the last 12 months, for example, it has outperformed all of the major dividend-oriented ETFs. The average portfolio from Investment Quality Trends has gained 16.9% over this period, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest.\n\nBetter yet, this superior return was produced with nearly 20% less volatility, or risk \u2014 which means its performance on a risk-adjusted basis is even better than the raw numbers already suggest.\n\nIts record over the longer term has also been impressive. Over the 25 years the Hulbert Financial Digest has tracked it, it has beaten a buy-and-hold by one percentage point per year on an annualized basis, while nevertheless incurring 14% less risk.\n\nInvestment Quality Trends currently is in third place for risk-adjusted performance over the last 25 years.\n\nWhich high-quality stocks are currently recommended by this approach? The following is Wright\u2019s \u201cTimely Ten\u201d list of his top 10 current recommendations:\n\nThis package of 10 stocks not only has an average dividend yield of 2.6% but, Wright is convinced, has good capital-appreciation potential in the event of a continuation of the bull market, and healthy downside protection in the event of a bear market.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/stWPJLBZcDU/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-01T13:01:39", "title": "The 5 biggest investor mistakes of 2013", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 The biggest mistake investors will make in 2013 will be to reduce their equity positions in favor of either cash or bonds.\n\nThat, at least, was the consensus of a panel of top-performing advisers assembled Thursday at the World Money Show in Orlando. The show\u2019s sponsor, InterShow, had asked me to be the moderator.\n\nThe four panelists were chosen because each had a high ranking in the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s performance ratings: Douglas Gerlach, editor of Investor Advisory Service; Jim Lowell, editor of several advisory services, including Fidelity Investor and ETF Trader; Louis Navellier, editor of several advisory services, including Blue Chip Growth Letter and Emerging Growth Letter; and Roger Conrad, editor of Utility Forecaster. (Click here to view a video of the panel.)\n\nThe focus of the discussion was the \u201c5 Biggest Mistakes To Avoid in 2013.\u201d Here\u2019s my take on the consensus that emerged:\n\nMistake #1: Giving up on the stock market. The panelists were unanimous in advising investors not to shift assets out of equities into fixed-income. Investors who buy bonds right now are locking in negative inflation-adjusted returns, for example. \u201cDon\u2019t let fear dominate your investment decision making,\u201d one panelist urged.\n\nMistake #2: Betting on the overall stock market. Calling this a mistake might seem odd, given Mistake #1. But a number of panelists believe that the stock market advance this year will become increasingly narrow \u2014 becoming a market of stocks rather than a monolithic stock market. Profiting in the stock market will therefore require us to be more and more selective in our investments.\n\nMistake #3: Overweighting aggressive stocks. All the panelists emphasized the need to focus primarily on conservative stocks. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean buying stocks that pay high dividends, though it might. It also means buying stocks that have good fundamentals, a solid business model, a fairly predictable and consistent earnings stream, and are trading for relatively low valuations.\n\nMistake #4: Paying too much attention to politics. The panelists were united that good-quality companies are able to adapt to whatever the political environment may be in Washington. Finding and investing in them should be our focus, rather than trying to predict the outcome of our inscrutable political process. As one panelist put it: \u201cDon\u2019t let a politician tell you what to do in your portfolio.\u201d\n\nMistake #5: Being a dumb trader. The panelists had a number of examples of this kind of mistake. One is setting stop-losses that are too close. That\u2019s because of high-frequency trading, which makes it more likely than ever that such stops will be needlessly \u2014 and expensively \u2014 triggered. Another example is trading too actively in less-liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs), something guaranteed to make the marketmakers rich. \u201cYou\u2019d be shocked how much money Wall Street makes\u201d from the frequent trading of ETFs, one panelist argued.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/d_g2a4o0szM/story.asp", "published": "2013-01-31T06:11:22", "title": "Is Facebook growing fast enough?", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 Facebook Inc.\u2019s revenue is growing at a fast pace. But it isn\u2019t growing fast enough to support the social network\u2019s current stock price.\n\nFacebook FB, -2.76% released its latest quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday \u2014 reporting quarterly revenue of $1.59 billion. That brought revenue for all of last year to $5.1 billion. See: Facebook\u2019s results beat estimates\n\nThat\u2019s a big number, for sure, and certainly seems impressive.\n\nTo understand why I nevertheless believe that it\u2019s not good enough, it\u2019s helpful to review a back-of-the-envelope calculation of Facebook\u2019s valuation that I introduced in a column immediately after the company went public last May at $38 per share. Follow full coverage of Facebook\u2019s quarterly results and conference call.\n\nThat calculation required just three inputs:\n\nFacebook\u2019s revenue growth rate over its first five years as a publicly traded company. I assumed that it would be the same as the average of all U.S. IPOs between 1996 and 2005 \u2014 212% cumulatively, or 25.6% on an annualized basis (after excluding spinoffs and buyouts).\n\nFacebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in five years\u2019 time. I assumed it would be the same as Google\u2019s is today GOOG, +0.01%\n\nThe rate of return Facebook investors would require to hold the stock for the five years after its IPO. Generously, I assumed the market\u2019s long-term average return of 11%. If I had assumed a higher return number, then the outcome of my analysis would have been an even lower fair value today.\n\nArmed with these three otherwise generous inputs, calculating a fair price for Facebook was a matter of simple math: As I reported last May, that price was $13.80. Read previous column: Facebook\u2019s stock should trade for $13.80.\n\nHow can Facebook overcome this awful fate? Since investors won\u2019t be happy earning less than 11% per year, and since it\u2019s unreasonable to expect the company\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2017 to be markedly higher than Google\u2019s is today, the only realistic way for Facebook to overcome my dismal price target is for its revenue growth rate to be far higher than 25.6% per year through 2016.\n\nGetty Images Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n\nYet the company has not shown that it can maintain this much higher revenue growth rate.\n\nTo be sure, it might on the surface seem otherwise. The company\u2019s revenues for calendar 2012 were 37% higher than in 2011.\n\nBut, according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who is one of academia\u2019s leading experts on IPOs, the typical pattern is for a post-IPO company\u2019s revenue growth rate to decline over its first several years after going public.\n\nTo average 25.6% over its first five years after coming to market, therefore, a company\u2019s revenue growth in its first couple of years needs to be above that rate.\n\nConsider, for instance, the average revenue growth rate over the first three years after a company comes to market. According to Ritter, this three-year growth rate was 36.7% per year for the same sample of IPOs that produced a five-year annualized growth rate of 25.6%.\n\nSo Facebook\u2019s revenue growth over this past year is almost precisely in line with the rate that was the basis of my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nHow, then, is Wall Street able to persuade itself that Facebook should be trading at its currently high price? As far as I can tell, by assuming Facebook deserves to have a sky-high price-to-sales ratio \u2014 not just now, but also well into the future.\n\nConsider, according to FactSet, the consensus estimate of Facebook\u2019s revenues in calendar 2015 \u2014 the furthest year out for which a consensus estimate is provided. That consensus is $10.5 billion\u2014not that far off of what was implied by my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nAssuming that consensus is on target, and assuming Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2015 will be the same as Google\u2019s is today, then Facebook\u2019s market cap at the end of 2015 would be around $52 billion. That\u2019s some 25% lower than where the company\u2019s market cap stands today.\n\nDon\u2019t like the conclusions of my calculations? Be my guest and go through the exercise yourself, employing any of the standard valuation metrics. And use your calculations to subject Facebook\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report to a smell test.\n\nMy hunch is that if you do so, you will not be running out to buy Facebook stock afterward.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/WztdRhRt8IM/story.asp", "published": "2013-01-25T17:27:45", "title": "Apple\u2019s drop shows price of popularity", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

Eurostat, the EU statistics institute, said on Wednesday that industrial production had declined by 2.1% in December in the eurozone, compared with the previous month, and by 4.1% over the same month of 2018.

The proposal calls for tightening eligibility requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, and toughening Medicaid eligibility requirements, such as enforcing asset limits.\n\nThe good news for Medicare and Social Security retirement beneficiaries: These cuts don\u2019t directly affect participants\u2019 benefits. The bad news: provisions within the proposal could undermine retirement security all the same.\n\nThe plan supports combating the opioid epidemic, increasing vocational training for high school students, assisting incarcerated persons with reentering communities and increasing security at the U.S. borders, among other recommendations. The plan would make a \u201cbig dent\u201d in the federal budget deficit, said Russell Vought, the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget acting director.\n\nSee: This could be the most important retirement savings vehicle for 2020\n\nSome of the reductions to Medicare would actually help beneficiaries, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Medicare spending reductions along with reforms to prescription drug pricing would amount to roughly $600 billion in savings, which could lead to lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe downside for Medicare participants: some of the changes could affect health care choices for patients. The proposal suggests a reduction of payments to health care providers \u2014 such as doctors and hospitals \u2014 and if the payments are cut too much, some providers may not participate in the Medicare program, said Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. If that were to happen, seniors would have limited options for selecting their own doctors, he said.\n\nThe plan would also extend the time beneficiaries need to spend in intensive care units before they\u2019re authorized to have long-term care at skilled nursing facilities thereafter, said Monique Morrissey, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Right now, the requirement is three consecutive days (not including the day of discharge), but the proposal changes that to eight days.\n\nThe budget doesn\u2019t focus too much on Social Security\u2019s old-age benefits, which pay out retirement benefits, but it does make changes to Social Security Disability, which affects Americans of all ages, and Supplemental Security Income, for seniors with limited income or resources. The proposal includes promoting work for SSDI and SSI beneficiaries, which is unlikely to happen, Goldwein said. Beneficiaries who claim disability insurance are usually severely disabled, and attempting to move them off the system would be \u201cdraconian,\u201d Adcock said. \u201cIt stacks the deck against them by trying to push them out of the program.\u201d\n\nOlder Americans are disproportionately affected by cuts to disability programs, Morrissey said \u2014 especially those who haven\u2019t turned 65 yet and therefore can\u2019t receive Medicare coverage. \u201cThe problem is those who will never work again,\u201d she said.\n\nAdditionally, retroactive benefits would be reduced from 12 months to six months for disability beneficiaries, Goldwein said. Other savings come from funding for SSDI and SSI program integrity, such as attempting to limit fraud or double payments.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: This word describes Social Security \u2014 but not everyone wants to hear it\n\nSome of these changes, such as ones to Medicare, would help sustain the programs, Goldwein said, and ideas found in the proposal have been echoed in Democrats\u2019 proposals, too. \u201cThe reality is, the cost of Medicare is high and growing fast,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make changes soon and these are good ideas with bipartisan support.\u201d\n\nThere are recommendations that highlight assistance to seniors in other ways, such as creating approximately 1,200 housing units for low-income elderly and persons with disabilities.\n\nMedicaid is also in the spotlight \u2014 the proposal reintroduces asset limits and restricts eligibility for able-bodied adults, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nThe budget proposes slashing certain programs that benefit older Americans\u2019 quality of life, including those that give them jobs and nutritious meals, Adcock said.\n\nThe proposal eliminates federal block grants that support Meals on Wheels, the program that delivers healthy meals to seniors who may otherwise be socially isolated, as well as eliminates the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps low-income families pay for energy bills and keep their homes warm during cold months.\n\nThe budget, if passed as is, would also eliminate the Senior Community Service Employment Program, which assists low-income and unemployed Americans 55 years and older with finding part-time training for jobs at nonprofit organizations. \u201cThe program is a lifesaver to a lot of seniors,\u201d Adcock said, adding that many older Americans are at risk of running out of retirement savings and could use a salary to prolong their finances.\n\nAlso see: Trump\u2019s election year gamble: Slashing the social safety net\n\nUnder the proposal, SNAP participants would be required to have 20 hours of work, training or community engagement in order to receive benefits. \u201cWe don\u2019t think of those as programs for the elderly, but they are important ones for retirement security and those who can\u2019t work,\u201d said Shawn Fremstad, senior policy fellow at the Center for Economic Policy and Research.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the Trump administration has suggested cutting funds to entitlement programs. The White House made similar suggestions for fiscal years 2020 and 2019. But this is an election year, and Congress members up for reelection may be hesitant to vote for cuts to these programs, Fremstad said.\n\nThe proposed cuts also come less than a week after the president said he would protect Medicare and Social Security during his Feb. 4 State of the Union speech.", "author": ["Alessandra Malito"]}, {"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B38731CC2-4CD3-11EA-B630-D3AA685BDC0A%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-02-12T12:30:14", "title": "Coronavirus could drive up out-of-stocks at stores by April: Wells Fargo", "text": "Shoppers could start seeing empty store shelves as soon as mid-April due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to Wells Fargo analysts who say concern about the supply chain is rising among retailers.\n\nStore closures and guidance cuts have been the primary impact of the outbreak on the retail sector thus far, leaving the supply chain largely unaffected.\n\nWells Fargo said that inventories are healthy at the moment, thanks to retailer efforts to get ahead of tariff issues and the Lunar New Year.

He said there is no financial threshold for the size of the horizontal and vertical deals it plans to look at. The request grew out of the FTC\u2019s hearing last year on transaction activity among tech companies, he added.\n\nHe said the FTC would focus on deals of companies that could have potentially developed into larger businesses, and moves by tech giants that increased their influence in adjacent markets.

Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, Google\u2019s purchases of YouTube and DoubleClick, and Amazon\u2019s merger with Whole Foods all received clearance from the FTC before closing.\n\nHowever, Big Tech makes myriad smaller deals every year that are never announced and do not go through regulatory channels.

U.S. agricultural purchases by China are part of a phase one trade deal both countries signed last month to ease trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. \"We expect the phase one deal will allow China to import more food and open those markets to American farmers,\" O'Brien said. \"As we watch this coronavirus outbreak unfold in China it could have an impact on how big, at least in this current year, the purchases are.\" He also said that the United States has offered China the \"opportunity\" to have American doctors and health experts on the ground to help contain the virus' spread. \"That offer has not been accepted at this point, but that's an outstanding offer,\" he said.\n\n8:05 am: Another 39 cases reported on cruise ship docked in Japan\n\nAnother 39 people tested positive for the coronavirus on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship currently quarantined at sea off the coast of Japan, ship operator Princess Cruises said Tuesday evening stateside.

You can expect him to maybe stay in the race for another three weeks or so until the Super Tuesday primaries are over, but that's about it.\n\nYes, there are a couple of examples of candidates who failed in Iowa and New Hampshire who went to win their party's presidential nomination. But none failed as spectacularly as Biden has.\n\nThis is over.\n\nBut the more important questions to answer are: What happened? Why did Biden fall out of favor so quickly?\n\nThe answer is Biden's cachet in this election cycle has always been what people assumed his strengths would be. A long-time senator and former vice president from a blue-collar state like Delaware was presumably a natural threat to President Donald Trump in the general election. All the polls said so for what seemed like more than a year, didn't they?\n\nBut anyone who really knew Biden and his personal political history also knew that we've been in this place before with him. On paper, Biden has always seemed more formidable than he ends up being on primary election day. His short-lived previous presidential campaigns in 1988 and 2008 both ended with no primary victories or even top-two finishes.\n\nWhat happened then to Biden is what's happening to him now. The more the voters get a look at the actual Joe Biden, and not just his resume, the less they like him. We can focus all we want on policy statements, voting records, etc. But in the end, the voters always choose the most persuasive candidate.\n\nBiden, other than his many U.S. Senate election wins in his tiny state of Delaware, has never been a very persuasive candidate for a wider selection of Democrats. As long as his candidacy most closely mirrored that of a \"generic Democratic challenger\" to Trump, he was going to lead the field in the polls. But once the voters got a closer look at the real Biden with his actual campaign persona, they quickly changed their minds just as they always have.\n\nAll of us got to see an example of how Biden starts strong, but finishes weakly, just a few days ago in New Hampshire. At a town hall campaign event, a Democratic Party voter asked told Biden she had a tough question for him. Biden played it brilliantly at first, comically taking off his jacket as if he physically needed to prepare for the tougher question.\n\nThen the woman proceeded to ask Biden if he could recover from his weak finish in Iowa. Biden began by trying to explain that Iowa's caucus system is different and he quickly asked the woman if she had ever been to a caucus. When the woman answered that she had, Biden fell off the proverbial cliff, calling her a \"lying dog faced pony soldier.\" It was bizarre and insulting, (the woman told reporters she felt humiliated by the comment), despite the Biden campaign's insistence that it was just a good-natured jibe.\n\nThe predictable effects of the impeachment process didn't help Biden, either. Shining a repeated light on the fact that Biden's son Hunter did receive a lucrative foreign job he wasn't apparently qualified for certainly didn't help Biden's brand. With the impeachment trial wrapping up the same week as the Iowa caucuses and less than 10 days before New Hampshire wasn't ideal for team Biden.\n\nBut Democrats will be foolish to put too much stock in the allegations against the Biden family as the reason for the former vice president's latest campaign demise. At best, the allegations of corruption are more like one of those fake excuses people use for not choosing a candidate when the real reason is they just don't personally connect with him or her.\n\nBiden's lack of persuasive abilities outside of Delaware is what's always doomed his White House aspirations. A few more years of experience and opposing Trump were never going to change that. More than three decades of history was staring the Democrats pushing Biden's campaign all along, and they should have seen this coming.\n\nNow, the big question is who will reel in those Biden defectors in the future primary races. So far, it appears the lion's share of Biden's voters have swung to former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg with a decent share also going to Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. That development could be enough to derail the path to the nomination for Sen. Bernie Sanders. But Sanders seems likely to pick up all or most of the voters still supporting Sen.

Mehedi Hasan | NurPhoto | Getty Images\n\nThe new coronavirus that has already killed more people than the 2003 SARS epidemic appears to be sparing one population group: kids. Of the more than 43,100 people it's infected since Dec. 31, World Health Organization officials say the majority are over 40 years old and it's hitting those with underlying health conditions and the elderly particularly hard. \"Increasing age increases the risk for death,\" Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO's emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said Thursday at a news conference at the agency's headquarters in Geneva. \"It appears even over 80 is the highest risk factor.\" Fortunately for many worried parents, there appear to be few confirmed cases of the virus among children so far. Officials caution that the virus is so new, there is still a lot that they don't know about it and the data they are seeing today will likely look different a month from now.\n\nAbout 80% of people who died from the virus in China were over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, according to a recent report from China's National Health Commission. A small study published Jan 30 in the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet found that the average age of coronavirus patients was roughly 55 years old. The study looked at 99 patients at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, from Jan. 1 to Jan. 20. Last week, Singapore confirmed a case in a 6-month-old baby whose parents were also both infected, and an infant in China was born Feb. 2 with the virus. The baby's mother also tested positive. But infections in children appear to rare for now, according to a Feb. 5 study in the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association. Symptoms can include a sore throat, runny nose, fever or pneumonia and can progress to multi-organ failure or even death in some cases, world health officials say.\n\nSome infectious disease specialists and scientists say older adults may be more vulnerable to the virus, which has been named COVID-19, due to their weaker immune systems. With age, immune systems weaken, leaving the elderly at an especially higher risk of developing serious complications from a respiratory illness, public health officials say. \"It's usually the very old, sometimes the very young and certainly people with other medical conditions who typically have more severe manifestations,\" said Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the University of Toronto. The apparent lack of children among confirmed coronavirus cases could also be because they are getting infected but developing more mild symptoms and aren't being reported to local authorities, according to Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. World health officials say they are working to improve surveillance of the disease and expect more mild cases to be reported. It could be a while before we have a clear picture on cases, Lipsitch said. \"The data is coming out in so many places and so many forms,\" he said in a recent interview. The differences in symptoms among different age groups are seen in other respiratory illnesses as well. The seasonal flu, which infects millions in the U.S. each year, can usually be more severe in adults than children. Thousands of children are hospitalized each year from the flu, but death is rare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, between 50% and 70% of flu-related hospitalizations in the U.S. occur in people 65 years and older, and between 70% and 85% of deaths occur in the same age group, the CDC says.", "author": ["Berkeley Lovelace Jr."]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/new-hampshire-primary-amy-klobuchar-tops-joe-biden-and-elizabeth-warren.html", "published": "2020-02-12T04:06:03", "title": "Amy Klobuchar's campaign gets a boost as Biden and Warren fizzle in New Hampshire", "text": "Democratic presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar speaks to supporters at her New Hampshire primary night rally in Concord, New Hampshire, U.S. February 11, 2020.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Sen.

She was also poised to win multiple delegates, while one-time front-runners former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen.

For anything that goes wrong. He blames Barack Obama. He blames the city of Baltimore. He blames the head of the Federal Reserve that he appointed. He blames the Energy Secretary that he nominated.

I will bring this country together instead of tearing it apart.\"\n\nKlobuchar is vying for the middle lane with Buttigieg, another moderate who also campaigns on a message of pragmatism and reaching across the aisle to work with Republicans.\n\n\"If you want a Democratic nominee who can make our tent bigger, who can make our coalition wider, and make our coattails longer, I know you, and I will fight for you,\" Klobuchar said Tuesday night.\n\nYet by effectively splitting the vote of moderate Democrats, Klobuchar and Buttigieg cleared the path for Sanders, an ardent progressive, to come away with the biggest single slice of delegates out of New Hampshire.\n\nAfter finishing in fifth place in the Iowa caucuses earlier this month, Klobuchar's finish Tuesday also places her directly in the path of the two candidates who did better than she did in Iowa, only to finish behind her in New Hampshire: Warren and Biden.\n\nNeither Biden nor Warren were on pace to finish Tuesday with enough votes to secure any delegates. It was a surprisingly poor finish for Warren. But for Biden, it was a five alarm fire.\n\nKlobuchar's Tuesday finish followed her strongest debate performance so far in the campaign, last Friday in New Hampshire. There, Klobuchar landed rhetorical blows on Buttigieg over comments he made about how Americans wanted to \"switch off\" the Trump impeachment hearings and \"watch cartoons.\"\n\n\"Pete, as you were campaigning through Iowa, as three of us were jurors in that impeachment hearing, you said it was exhausting to watch and that you wanted to turn the channel and watch cartoons. It is easy to go after Washington because that's a popular thing to do,\" Klobuchar said. \"It is much harder to lead and much harder to take those difficult positions.\"\n\nAs the Democratic primary moves to Nevada next for a caucus Feb. 22, Sanders is again expected to finish in the top spot, with Real Clear Politics' polling average for the state showing Klobuchar in seventh place, behind even entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire Tom Steyer. Yang dropped out of the race Tuesday night.\n\nFor Klobuchar, the next real test of her campaign's viability will be Super Tuesday, March 3, when voters in 14 states cast ballots in the Democratic presidential primary. Currently, the Minnesota senator lacks the extensive ground operations in these states that many of her competitors have built. Nor does she have the money to blanket the airwaves in dozens of media markets.\n\nAll is not lost for Klobuchar, however. In the weeks leading up to Super Tuesday, Democrats plan to hold two televised debates, and as a candidate, Klobuchar has proven particularly competitive on the debate stage.\n\nA standout performance in one or both of these debates could fuel Klobuchar's campaign well beyond the traditional Super Tuesday firewall.", "author": ["Christina Wilkie"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/trump-would-rather-face-bloomberg-than-sanders-in-2020-election.html", "published": "2020-02-12T01:16:13", "title": "Trump says he would rather face Bloomberg than Sanders: Bernie 'has real followers'", "text": "People cheer as Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leads polls of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary as he gains traction nationally. As former Vice President Joe Biden falters, billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has climbed in national surveys, fueled by spending tens of millions of dollars of his fortune. Trump, during a rambling criticism of Bloomberg's 2015 comments that defended his city's stop-and-frisk policing practice with racist stereotypes, said unprompted that he would rather face the businessman than the Vermont senator. He pointed to Sanders' devoted supporters, who fueled an insurgent challenge to former secretary of State and senator Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\"Frankly, I'd rather run against Bloomberg than Bernie Sanders,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"Because Sanders has real followers, whether you like him or not, whether you agree with him or not. I happen to think it's terrible what he says. But he has followers. Bloomberg's just buying his way in.\" As Democrats consider who to put up against Trump in November's general election, many voters say they have thought most about who has the best chance to oust the president. NBC News exit polls of New Hampshire on Tuesday found 62% of Democrats would rather see a nominee who can beat Trump, while 34% would prefer a candidate who agrees with them. Trump has also kept a close eye on the field. Supporters of Biden, who has run a campaign around his ability to defeat Trump, have repeatedly said Trump asked Ukraine to investigate the former vice president and his son Hunter because he feared facing Biden in November. Trump's push for a probe sat at the center of the House's decision to impeach him, and the Senate acquitted the president last week. At the same time, Sanders' rivals including Biden have contended the senator, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist who has pushed for a vast expansion of the social safety net, would struggle to beat Trump. Sanders has fought that characterization, telling supporters in New Hampshire on Monday night that he can win because \"our agenda speaks to the pain of the working families of this country.\"", "author": ["Jacob Pramuk"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-price-release-date.html", "published": "2020-02-11T19:44:47", "title": "Samsung's new folding phone has a screen that bends in half \u2014 it launches Feb. 14 for $1,380", "text": "Samsung announced the $1,380 Galaxy Z Flip during a press event in San Francisco on Tuesday.

David Powell, medical advisor at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), told CNBC the risk of catching any serious viral infection during a flight is \"very low\" as the air on planes is purified with surgical-grade filters. However, he said the risk remained if passengers were close to somebody on board who was unwell during the journey. \"We know that this virus has spread in the vast majority of cases through close contact with someone who is unwell at the time,\" he explained to CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" on Wednesday. \"So that risk is what remains, and there are simple things you can do to reduce that risk, but through the air supply the risk is low.\" Powell said that amid the coronavirus crisis in China, the most crucial way to minimize exposure to the infection was to practice good hand hygiene. \"Respiratory viruses transmit mostly through droplet spread \u2014 which is coughing or sneezing on somebody \u2014 or in some cases by fomite spread, which means you contaminate a surface which another person then immediately touches,\" he explained. \"So hand hygiene is the primary thing.\" That means anyone worried about exposure should avoid touching their own face and frequently wash and dry their hands \u2014 or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if they aren't able to access hand washing facilities.\n\nAccording to Powell, another way to stop the spread of any virus on board an airplane is to observe \"cough etiquette.\" \"So (that means) coughing or sneezing into a tissue, and if you can't do that then cough into your elbow and then immediately clean your hands,\" he advised. \"And then of course, not flying when you are yourself unwell.\" While taking preventative measures to reduce potential exposure to coronavirus could be effective, Powell said travellers should take action if they noticed a fellow passenger appeared to be ill on a flight. \"If somebody nearby you is unwell on the aircraft, you should bring that to the attention of the crew because there are established procedures they can take to separate that person and minimize risk to others,\" he explained. He also urged anyone suffering with potential coronavirus symptoms to seriously rethink their travel plans. \"It does appear from all the information I've seen that the commonest first symptom of this illness is fever, and quite a high fever, typically over 38 degrees (Celsius),\" Powell told CNBC. \"So if anybody's got a high temperature they certainly shouldn't travel, and that's advice that we've given long before this outbreak.\" He also noted that face masks were an \"ineffective protection\" against coronavirus, and would only be advised for those who were caring for someone who was unwell or coughing and sneezing themselves. Medical experts around the world have also suggested that hand washing is the most effective way people can protect themselves from coronavirus. \"One of the most important ways of stopping respiratory outbreaks such as this is washing hands,\" David Heymann, who led WHO's infectious disease unit at the time of the SARS epidemic, said at a press briefing in London last week.", "author": ["Chloe Taylor"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/lyft-q4-2019-earnings.html", "published": "2020-02-11T22:39:17", "title": "Lyft beats revenue estimates but stock falls", "text": "Lyft reported earnings for its fourth quarter of 2019 Tuesday that beat analyst estimates on revenue and active riders.

In its fourth quarter 2019 earnings report last week, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company was moving its EBITDA profitability target to Q4 2020, earlier than its original promise of becoming profitable for the full year 2021.\n\nLyft has previously said it expects to be profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis by the fourth quarter of 2021. It did not address its profitability target in its earnings press release, and CFO Brian Roberts told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa that he would address profitability on the call with analysts Tuesday afternoon but would not answer CNBC's questions about a timeline.\n\nOn the call, Roberts reiterated Lyft's profitability target of the fourth quarter of 2021 and executives focused on Lyft's strategic partnerships and research and development efforts. They emphasized the company is investing heavily in innovative products and \"stretching every dollar\" when it comes to operating the business.\n\nLyft provided Q1 2020 revenue guidance between $1.055 billion and $1.060 billion, higher than the Refinitiv consensus estimate of $1.05 billion. It expects an adjusted EBITDA loss between $145 million and $140 million. Analysts were expecting an adjusted EBITDA loss of $161 million for the first quarter, according to Refinitiv.\n\nFor the full year 2020, Lyft expects revenues to fall between $4.575 billion and $4.650 billion compared to estimates of $4.59 billion, according to Refinitiv. Lyft expects an adjusted EBITDA loss of $490 million to $450 million compared to $503 million analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv.\n\nUber's quickened timeline has brought both more optimism and pressure to Lyft's report. Raymond James analysts said in a note Monday that Uber's strong earnings means \"Lyft arguably has a higher bar.\"\n\n\"We expect Lyft starts with conservative revenue guidance and raises the range as results dictate,\" the analysts wrote, maintaining an outperform rating and $85 price target.\n\nAnalysts at Guggenheim Securities, who have a buy rating on the stock with a $60 price target, said with Uber's new profitability goal, \"the race is on, but we are not sure that LYFT wants or needs to win.\"\n\n\"We see it as acceptable for a #2 player like LYFT to tilt strategically more towards growth and market share, as long as it is still on track and progressing towards EBITDA positive at some point in 2021,\" the Guggenheim analysts wrote in a Monday note.\n\nAnalysts also said they'll be paying attention to any updates on how Lyft will navigate new regulations like California's new gig worker law, Assembly Bill 5 (AB5). Roberts told CNBC it is now focused on ballot initiatives around regulation. On the earnings call, Roberts said the company is \"prepared to invest\" an incremental $75 million year over year on \"policy initiatives\" including in California.\n\n\"We believe this is the right approach to help protect the flexibility that our drivers value today,\" Roberts said.\n\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.\n\nWATCH: Inside Lyft's self-driving car lab", "author": ["Lauren Feiner"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/bitcoin-price-rises-above-10000-on-fed-chair-powell-cryptocurrency-comments-coronavirus.html", "published": "2020-02-12T09:48:38", "title": "Bitcoin hits highest price this year, above $10,000, as Fed Chair Powell discusses cryptocurrencies", "text": "Industry participants have attributed a number of factors to the rise of bitcoin, including some investors viewing the cryptocurrency as a sort of safe-haven asset in times of uncertainty.\n\nIn the early morning on Wednesday, bitcoin hit $10,489.78, the highest price it has logged since September, according to data from Coindesk.

From art shows to golf tournaments, countries like Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand have seen major events called off. The annual Art Basel Hong Kong 2020, one of Asia's most prestigious art fairs planned for March 19-21, was cancelled \"due to the severe outbreak and spread of the new coronavirus,\" according to organizers. Meanwhile, both the 2020 Honda LGPA Thailand in the Thai resort city of Pattaya, and the 2020 HSBC Women's World Championship in Singapore, were also called off. Both events were set to take place at the end of February. The Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) said on Monday the decision was made due to \"continued health concerns\" over the spread of the virus. As of Wednesday, Hong Kong had 49 confirmed cases, including one death. The number of confirmed cases in Singapore reached 47, while Thailand reported 33 cases so far.\n\nSARS and now\n\nThere are rising concerns within the travel and events industry that the economic impact of the new coronavirus will be felt in the coming months. Stuart Bailey, chairman of Hong Kong Exhibition & Convention Industry Association, said the Asian financial hub has postponed all MICE events for now. MICE refers to the Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions industry. While most can be rescheduled throughout the year, he noted that it will become harder to work around a backlog of events in the coming months.\n\nMaking reference to the 2003 SARS outbreak \u2014 which dealt a heavy blow to Asian economies including Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan \u2014 he said the likely postponement of events that were to be held in March and April will be \"pretty damaging\" to the Hong Kong economy. \"If events need to be held in the summer months ... July and August, maybe this is one of those years \u2014 you just do your best and muddle through,\" Bailey told CNBC last week. The disease \u2014 now officially named COVID-19 \u2014 is believed to have started in a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and has since infected more than 40,000 people and killed over 1,000 people in China alone. Most of the deaths and cases occurred in mainland China.\n\nCoronavirus impact on Singapore\n\nSingapore has not been spared either. The biennial Singapore Airshow, Asia's largest aerospace and defense event, chose to carry on despite concerns about the virus. However, more than 70 exhibitors pulled out before the airshow started on Feb. 11. They included major exhibitors like American aerospace and defense firm Lockheed Martin, and Canadian business jet manufacturers Bombardier. The Singapore Tourism Board said on Tuesday: \"The Novel Coronavirus has had a significant impact on visitor arrivals, especially from China, which accounts for around 20 per cent of international visitor arrivals.\" \"Based on the current situation, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) expects visitor arrivals this year to fall by about 25 to 30 per cent,\" according to a statement by the government agency, which helps promote the country's tourism industry.\n\nWhile the impact of the current outbreak on Singapore's MICE industry is still uncertain, an estimated 40% to 45% of event attendees dropped out at the height of the SARS outbreak in May 2003, Aloysius Arlando, president of the Singapore Association of Convention and Exhibition Organisers and Suppliers (SACEOS), told CNBC in early February. Having gone through previous episodes of SARS, the H1N1 swine flu and even the regular haze episodes of bad air quality, the Singapore MICE industry as a whole is more prepared, Arlando said.

This group of 771 delegates is made up of Democrats in Congress, state and local party officials, Democratic governors and other party leaders, such as former presidents and vice presidents. So if none of the candidates wins 1,990 delegates by July, the magic number to win becomes 2,376 \u2014 or just one vote more than half of all delegates, including the superdelegates. Then the delegates vote. The superdelegates are barred from the first vote. If that first vote doesn't produce a clear winner, the superdelegates are then allowed to vote, presumably to prevent a stalemate.\n\nWhat happens if none of the candidates gets a majority after all the delegates vote?\n\nIf that happens, expect plenty of behind-the-scenes deal-making as support shifts among the delegates pledged to candidates that no longer seem viable. Or the convention could settle on a compromise candidate who didn't even come close on the first round. It's been decades since multiple rounds of voting produced marathon conventions, but it could easily happen this summer. In 1924, the voting went more than 100 rounds before the Democrats settled on John W. Davis to run against the Republican incumbent, Calvin Coolidge. We may know fairly soon, though, whether the party is headed for a splintered convention. This year, the primary schedule is more heavily front-loaded than in the past. Some two-thirds of the pledged delegates will be chosen by the end of March.\n\nHow are the delegates chosen?\n\nThe pledged delegates are chosen directly by voters or indirectly in primaries or caucuses, where the delegate count is based more loosely on voter preferences. Some states hold a state convention where the delegates are officially designated. The superdelegates are chosen based on their party affiliation; many of them hold an elected office.\n\nHow many delegates does each state get?\n\nThe Democrats have a formula for that. You start with a \"base\" of 3,200 delegates nationwide and then apportion those delegates to each state based on how many votes Democrats cast in the last three elections, plus another share based on how many electoral votes each state gets. Each state then gets \"bonus\" votes on top of that, based on things such as when they choose to schedule their caucus or primary. You get bonus points if you pick a date that other states have picked, for example.\n\nSo the candidate who gets the most votes in a statewide caucus or primary gets the most delegates, right?\n\nSort of. The bulk of the pledged delegates \u2014 not the superdelegates \u2014 are picked based on the vote totals in each congressional district or state legislative district. Another batch, called at-large delegates, are chosen based on the total statewide vote. A third group, about 15% of the total, are called pledged PLEO delegates, which stands for Party Leader and Elected Officials. They're usually picked like the at-large group, based on overall state totals.\n\nSeriously?\n\nBut don't confuse the pledged PLEO delegates with those unpledged PLEO delegates, aka superdelegates, who don't vote unless there's a contest. The makeup of the superdelegate group can be hard to pin down. That's because the final list can change right up until they get to Milwaukee, as elected officials and party leaders come and go over the course of the campaign. That's for the states and Puerto Rico. There are also six delegates assigned to American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands. Democrats abroad get 12 at-large delegates and one superdelegate. And the exact headcounts get even trickier, because there's a lot of rounding going on in these calculations. You can't have a fractional delegate.\n\nWhat if a delegate can't make it to the convention?\n\nNo problem. Each state picks alternate delegates who stand in for absent delegates. They're still pledged to the same candidate as the regular delegate. Unless they're superdelegates, of course, who don't vote unless the convention is contested.\n\nWhat if the delegates who go to the national convention don't vote the way they're supposed to?", "author": ["John W.

Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nCentral banks are experiencing a soul-searching moment as they look to strengthen their popularity after the global financial crisis \u2014 an exercise that could ultimately change how they operate. The European Central Bank (ECB) is hosting its first \"listening event\" in Brussels next month. President Christine Lagarde is set to discuss with European citizens the role of the central bank across the 19-country region. However, the ECB is not the first major central bank to organize such events. The U.S. Federal Reserve announced in late 2018 that it would be reviewing its work, which included several \"Fed Listens\" events across the country. The results are set to be unveiled in the first half of 2020. \"The ECB is simply imitating the Fed, and both are doing the public consultations because they feel insecure as their instruments seem to have lost 'bite,'\" Daniel Gros, the director of the Brussels-based think tank CEPS, told CNBC via email.\n\nDifferent analysts argue that central banks are conducting these public exercises to receive reassurances on what they do, at a time when many have doubts about the effectiveness of their policy tools. \"Hoping to heal rifts between the ECB and the general public, in some countries, is certainly a big part of the exercise,\" Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg bank, told CNBC. Erik Jones, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University, said \"there is a lot of talk about the need for central banks to communicate more transparently \u2026 Part of this may be the result of a sense of exposure that central bankers felt when they were 'the only game in town' in the depths of the crisis.\"\n\nCentral banks have changed\n\nThe two major central banks have undergone a massive change in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. They were forced to expand their balance sheets and announced unconventional measures to support their respective economies. But the global financial community is now questioning whether both central banks have reached a limit. The International Monetary Fund said in November that \"concerns about the expanded activities of central banks led to skepticism about the necessity or the appropriate degree of central bank independence.\" At the same time, the general public seems largely unaware about the work conducted by these institutions.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that nothing will change at all. Erik Jones Professor at Johns Hopkins University\n\nThe new \"communication attitude\" is born \"from the awareness that, during the crisis and in its aftermath, central banks got to the limits of their powers and responsibilities and they have to show that, while indeed treading new ground, they remain faithful to their main mission,\" Francesco Papadia, senior resident fellow at the think tank Bruegel, told CNBC. The ECB's main mandate is to ensure stable prices in the euro zone. The Fed, apart from price stability, also monitors the U.S. labour market. Speaking to the European Parliament last week, ECB President Christine Lagarde said the aim of the public events is to \"learn directly from civil society organizations and the people what matters most to them, be that rising rents and house prices, job uncertainty or climate change.\"\n\nHow could monetary policy change?", "author": ["Silvia Amaro"]}]}, "cnbc_investing": {"rss": "https://www.cnbc.com/id/15839069/device/rss/rss.html", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/investing/", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/facebook-analyst-behind-tuesdays-drop-explains-his-downgrade-of-stock.html", "published": "2020-02-11T22:57:41", "title": "Facebook analyst explains why he downgraded the stock, preceding its slide", "text": "The Facebook analyst who downgraded the stock Tuesday told CNBC he is concerned about the growth of the social media giant's advertising business.\n\nIn particular, Pivotal Research Group analyst Michael Levine said he believes a slowdown in advertising from direct-to-consumer brands could spell bad news for Facebook.

His primary concern was the integrity of its management. We mentioned that a new management has taken over the company, but he responded that that there is not enough evidence that Boeing's values had changed across the organization to alter his opinion. We might call this approach \"penalty box\" investing.\n\nSince our inception, we have complied with both individual and institutional client requests to avoid certain stocks and industries, commonly fossil-fuel related. We chose not to purchase tobacco and gun stocks, because of our personal beliefs and because we heard frequent client objections to them.\n\nA couple of years ago, the tone changed entirely with Facebook. What had previously been an aversion to owning shares of a company selling cigarettes, assault rifles, or even gambling experiences, shifted to a rejection of the way in which a company, about whose products or services you might have no objection, conducts itself.\n\nIf Boeing is now in the penalty box for its management behavior surrounding the 737-MAX, how long might that last, and how will they make their way back onto the ice? The answer, of course, is that it depends. Factors include how egregious investors view the infraction, the length of time in which new pieces of negative news emerge, the complexity of the solution, and the way in which the \"guilty\" management handles the crisis and changes its practices.\n\nIn recent years, we have, a range of examples, including Wells Fargo, Facebook and Equifax. All three failed to protect their customers' privacy or capitalized on their access to client accounts without approval from them.\n\nWells Fargo engaged in a widespread fraud, opening millions of fee paying accounts without consent from its customers. While The Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times had unearthed the relentless cross-selling strategy years earlier, the scandal broke widely in September of 2016 when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced $100 million of fines on Wells.\n\nDespite management changes, repeated apologies in recent years, and restructuring of all the misguided sales incentives, the stock is still 12% below its level when the story emerged publicly. What good is a bank if you can't trust it with your money? Wells Fargo stock has attempted to recover, but strong competitors and low interest rates have depressed earnings.\n\nThe Facebook scandal, which hit the headlines in March, 2018, exposed how the social network had allowed the UK data mining firm, Cambridge Analytica, to access private information on over 87 million users without their knowledge. The stock fell 14% on the news, more than recovered to hit a high of $209 in July, but tumbled again when investors learned how much it would cost to monitor the website and improve security.\n\nSince the end of 2018, the stock has climbed over 60%, as investors have forgiven Facebook, or, at least, overlooked its transgressions. Unlike Wells Fargo, which violated an original bank commandment \u2014 to keep depositors' money safe \u2014 Facebook's raison d'etre is sharing, not privacy, and its platforms still dominate this market. Also, despite media outcry, the currency of privacy may have a lower value than real money.\n\nEquifax, the credit agency, was involved with a data breach in 2017, when personal information on close to 147 million Americans was hacked. The company paid a $650 million fine, apologized profusely, agreed to spend $1 billion on enhanced cybersecurity, and offered compensation to affected parties. Investors appear to have forgiven them; the stock is now at an all-time high.\n\nBoeing, down almost 30% from its high last March, still has its highest hurdle to overcome \u2014 the re-certification of the 737 Max by the Federal Aviation Administration. The investing public probably trusts the FAA, which feels the heat of this decision, and that seal of approval could prompt the company's release from the penalty box.\n\nLike Facebook, Boeing is the dominant U.S. player in its field. Once investors feel a higher authority has sanctioned the aircraft, they will likely look forward rather than back.\n\nMeanwhile, how should investors address their concerns about corporate behavior? Since most individuals hold equities via index or mutual funds, their allocations are tied to the index constituents without other considerations. Several fund complexes, such as Fidelity, Blackrock and, Schwab, now offer customers funds that are focused on environmental, social, and governance factors, which measure sustainability. Presumably, these ESG funds eliminate equities with poor rankings. Those investors who work with financial advisors should articulate their concerns about corporate behavior.\n\nESG rating systems offered by S&P, Morningstar, MSCI, and others are expensive for individuals, often costing more than $5,000 for comprehensive data. They can also vary widely between ranking systems for the same name, because each organization creates its own standards. Over time, customer demand will require the major firms offering ESG, socially responsible investing, or SRI, aligned products to provide more user-friendly and comprehensive analysis of company rankings.\n\nEven without standardized metrics of public corporate behavior or easy accessibility to the highest quality ratings systems, the public has numerous news sources on which to make its own judgments. The market concern for accountability and trust of all public companies is growing, and managements need character strength and awareness to avoid the \"penalty box.\"", "author": ["Karen Firestone"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/08/wall-street-analysts-have-never-been-this-bearish-on-tesla.html", "published": "2020-02-08T13:13:38", "title": "Wall Street analysts have never been this bearish on Tesla", "text": "Wall Street analysts are the most bearish they've ever been on Tesla following the stock's steep surge, which has seen shares nearly double this year. Many are saying the valuation looks stretched and is not supported by the underlying fundamentals. Some 45% of analysts currently have a sell rating on the stock, while just 19% say the stock is a buy, according to estimates from FactSet. The remainder, 36%, have a hold rating on the stock. This is the most bearish the Street has ever been on Tesla, going back to the company's initial public stock offering in June 2010. It's also the least bullish analysts have ever been.\n\nTesla's wild week\n\nShares of Tesla started the year in an uptrend, and a number of factors, including record vehicle deliveries in the fourth quarter, pushed the stock higher throughout January. On Jan. 29, the company reported fourth quarter earnings that blew through analyst estimates. This, in turn, kicked off a trading frenzy in the stock, which was already handily outperforming the broader market. On Monday, Tesla opened at $673.69, and then surged 19.89% in a single day to close at $780. On Tuesday, the stock broke above $900 for the first time, hitting an all-time high of $968.99, before paring some of those gains into the close, and ending the day with a gain of 13.7%. On Wednesday, some of the enthusiasm faded and shares tumbled 17%, in part because the company said the coronavirus outbreak would delay deliveries. Shares are now up 78% this year, and 220% in the last 6 months.\n\nAnalysts react to Tesla's meteoric rise\n\nTesla's rapid rise has many Wall Street analysts arguing that upside catalysts are already priced into the stock, and that the stock has now become detached from its underlying fundamentals. \"Taking our foot off the accelerator following the recent run,\" Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer said in a note to clients Wednesday as he downgraded the stock to a hold. Also downgrading the stock to a neutral rating, New Street Research said that there are \"limited sources of further appreciation in the next 12 months.\" Dorsheimer and Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas are among the analysts who argue that there will be a more attractive entry point for investors down the line. Jonas downgraded Tesla to an underweight rating on Jan. 16, citing a stretched valuation and an inability for the stock to maintain its strong momentum. He has a $360 target on the stock, which is 51% below where it currently trades.\n\n\"In our experience, we've never seen a stock rise that much that fast with such little regard to past fundamentals or track record,\" Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill said Wednesday while reiterating his underperform rating. \"Irrational exuberance\" has hit an all-time high, he added. He noted that the company has never posted a profit for an entire year, and that year-over-year revenue growth decelerated in 2019. Barclays compared the price action in the stock to the NASDAQ in 1999, saying it remains \"fundamentally overvalued,\" while Bank of America highlighted 10 reasons \"to stay cautious despite the hype.\" The list included Tesla's \"not good or consistent\" profitability and cash flow as well as the company's \"creative accounting.\" The firm has an underperform rating on the stock, and a $350 target.\n\nElon Musk speaks on stage during the Westworld Featured Session during SXSW at Austin Convention Center on March 10, 2018 in Austin, Texas.

Additionally, FactSet's ratings do not take into account every single Street analyst, and the ratio of bullish to bearish ratings depends, of course, on the number of people who cover the stock. \"Despite past production delays, parts shortages, labor cost overruns, and other difficulties, we expect Tesla to benefit from its dominant position in the electric vehicle industry and to improve performance in 2020 and beyond,\" Argus analyst Bill Selesky said on Monday as he upgraded the stock to a buy rating.

John Keeble | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nTesla's valuation has soared well past other automakers, even those that produce millions more cars each year, causing Morgan Stanley to take a look at whether Elon Musk's company is more accurately valued as a technology stock instead. \"It appears Tesla, in the market's view, has gone far past the point of comparison vs. traditional auto companies,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note to investors on Thursday. \"We think this is largely deserved \u2014 Tesla is a significantly faster growing auto company \u2026 and it is also more than an auto company.\" Although Jonas said \"Tesla can appear more reasonably valued\" versus some technology companies, the company's recent meteoric rise makes it even more expensive to own than Amazon or Apple. Morgan Stanley compared Tesla and several popular technology names on two key bases: their estimated 2025 enterprise value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio and their estimated 2025 revenue growth rate.\n\nSimply put, Morgan Stanley estimates Tesla is more expensive with lower growth than Amazon, is more expensive but has a higher growth rate than Apple or Netflix, and is cheaper than Spotify but has \"materially lower growth.\" The firm stuck by its underweight rating after this analysis and its $360 price target on Tesla \u2014 more than 50% below the stock's current levels. Keep in mind the shares appear more expensive than Amazon, Apple and Netflix even when using the analyst's cash flow and revenue estimates for five years from now, which could prove too optimistic. \"While the hyper growth story continues to manifest itself in consensus forecasts and sentiment, ultimately creating the comparison to high profile tech names, we believe there are a number of exogenous risks that investors should remain cognizant of such as competition, execution, and other geopolitical concerns,\" Jonas said. Nonetheless, Jonas said the debate will continue \"as to whether Tesla is an auto company, a tech company, or something altogether different.\"\n\nFears of a Tesla bubble\n\nSome analysts are worried that Tesla's rally \u2014 the stock has more than tripled in six months \u2014 is a speculative bubble that sometimes occurs in financial markets, especially near the end of bull markets. \"Tesla has gone parabolic,\" said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. \"This is taking Tesla well above a level that would be supported by its current fundamentals. \u2026 The stock is going to get absolutely clobbered at some point before long.\"\n\nEven political activist Ralph Nader chimed in, saying in one tweet: \"Watch out Tesla believers.\" \"When the stock market bubble implodes, it will have been started by the surge in Tesla shares beyond speculative zeal,\" Nader wrote. Tesla's remarkable run-up has drawn many comparisons but one of the most striking was the bitcoin bubble three years ago. After running up to nearly $20,000, bitcoin crashed 65% in just a month \u2013 and finished 2018 about 80% below its peak level.\n\nDefending Tesla's growth", "author": ["Michael Sheetz"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/junk-bond-scare-is-rising-no-one-cares-people-are-buying-everything.html", "published": "2020-02-07T18:11:50", "title": "Junk bond scare is rising: 'No one cares.

The utilities sector gained 6.61% in January, far surpassing the S&P 500, which finished down 0.2% for the opening month. Technology was the next closest sector at 3.89%, and pulled ahead of the utilities for the year with a strong start to February. The recent spike for utilities has raised some eyebrows among investors and strategists. \"Utilities going parabolic? Now I've seen everything!\" Matt Malek of Miller Tabak & Co. said in a note to clients during the middle of the sharp jump. The rapid gain may be an anomaly, but the sector's outperformance is actually a longer-term trend. \"Since U.S. economic growth peaked in 2Q18, utilities have far away been the best-performing Level 1 Sector, returning 45.4 percent,\" Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson said in a note last month, adding that this was roughly double the return of the S&P 500 and 7 percentage points better than the technology sector. When looking at the price returns of the widely traded Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF, the gap isn't quite as big, but it's still greater than 10 percentage points.\n\nPart of the reason for the strength of utilities is lower interest rates. The Fed raised rates at the beginning of this run, with two hikes toward the end of 2018, but reversed course with three 25 basis point cuts last year. The low-interest rate environment has given utility stocks, which on average have a dividend yield of about 3%, a healthy premium to 10-year Treasury rates and other low-yield fixed income assets, said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. \"I feel like if you're picking up over 100 basis points with the upside potential of an equity, that's a pretty good trade,\" Gaffney said.\n\nSafe haven with growth?", "author": ["Jesse Pound"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/even-big-short-steve-eisman-is-giving-up-on-betting-against-tesla.html", "published": "2020-02-05T21:03:48", "title": "Even 'Big Short' Steve Eisman is giving up on betting against Tesla", "text": "Steve Eisman, one of the investors who famously bet against the subprime mortgage crisis, said he has killed his money-losing bet against Tesla amid its \"cult-like\" rally.\n\n\"I covered it a while ago,\" Eisman told Bloomberg Television on Wednesday. \"Look, everybody has a pain threshold.

Not only is Tesla a leader in electric vehicles, but its growing battery, solar and autonomous driving divisions will fuel future gains. Essentially, it's a leader in its field, and the competition is well behind, say those who favor the stock.\n\n\"I think they have potential for a trillion dollars of revenue within 10 years, so basically you're looking at the very start of Tesla; this can be one of the largest companies in the whole world,\" billionaire investor Ron Baron said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" Baron said he's not selling one of the nearly 1.63 million shares that his firm, Baron Capital, holds. In addition to strong demand for the Model Y and Cybertruck, he noted that the company's energy storage business is doubling each year, and that the solar division, which he said is just getting started, is already worth between $40 billion and $50 billion. \"It's not just the next 10 years that's going to be phenomenal growth, it's going to be years after that,\" he added. The bullish investors still see a fundamental case for the company at these levels, even as many others decry the run as a bubble. On Tuesday, Tesla was trading around $930, up about 120% for the year.\n\n$7,000 target\n\nInvestors who are optimistic on the stock highlight that the company has a competitive advantage in the electric vehicle market since they've been manufacturing 100% electric vehicles since 2008 \u2014 well before other auto companies \u2014 and also because they can streamline their operations since they focus solely on electric vehicles. Other companies, however, have to split their operations between internal combustion engine and electric vehicle manufacturing. And the more vehicles Tesla makes, the cheaper each one becomes to produce. On Monday Panasonic, which has a joint venture with Tesla, said their automotive battery business was profitable for the first time, and also that they would be ramping up production to keep up with demand from the automaker. \"Tesla has not lost market share in the EV market and traditional autos have had a really hard time producing a car that's on par with Tesla in terms of a dollar per performance or efficiency basis,\" ARK Invest's Tasha Keeney told CNBC Tuesday.

After bitcoin's unprecedented run to nearly $20,000 a piece in 2017, the cryptocurrency crashed a whopping 65% in a span of just one month. By the end of 2018, bitcoin fell below $4,000, an 80% drop from its peak. Others are getting flashbacks to the dot-com bubble in early 2000s, when internet stocks exploded and eventually collapsed, shedding nearly 80% of value within seven months. In December 1999 before the bursting of the tech bubble, Amazon's valuation hit more than 50 times its IPO price. Right now, Tesla is trading at about 98 times forward earnings, according to FactSet.\n\nTesla vs. Volkswagen\n\nPerhaps the most glaring parallel could be drawn between Tesla today and Volkswagen in 2008. Including Monday's surge in Tesla's stock, investors betting against it have lost more than $8 billion since the beginning of the year, according to data from S3 Partners.\n\nShort sellers are investors who borrow shares from a bank and then sell them, hoping the stock will go down. If it does, then the short sellers buy them back at lower prices and return them to the bank, profiting on the difference. Musk's Tesla has more investors betting against the company than any other U.S. stock, according to S3. If enough short sellers are forced to cover their shorts and buy back the stock at the same time, it can create higher demand and itself drive the stock price even higher, a phenomenon also known as \"a short squeeze.\" Similar moves triggered by short selling happened to Volkswagen in 2008 after Porsche took a stake in the company, catching investors betting against the stock off guard. At that time, the short sellers notoriously pushed the German automaker to become the world's most valuable company. The stock briefly topped Exxon Mobil's $343 billion market capitalization as short sellers paid high amounts, desperate to get out of their positions.\n\n\"Watch out Tesla believers\"\n\nTesla has had only a handful of profitable quarters in its history and it has never been profitable on an annual basis.", "author": ["Maggie Fitzgerald Yun Li", "Maggie Fitzgerald", "Yun Li"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/cramer-sees-tesla-shares-worth-twice-combined-market-value-of-gm-ford.html", "published": "2020-02-04T21:07:26", "title": "Cramer sees Tesla worth twice the combined market cap of GM and Ford \u2014 it was just shy Tuesday", "text": "Tesla's market value deserves to be twice the combined value of General Motors and Ford, CNBC's Jim Cramer said before Tuesday's Wall Street open.\n\nAt that point, the \"Mad Money\" host said he would reevaluate.\n\nHowever, during Tuesday's session, Tesla's stock basically got there.\n\nShares of the electric-auto maker opened at nearly $883 per share, and then raced to an all-time intraday high of $968.99, hitting a market cap above $170 billion.\n\nThe stock, which closed at $887 per share, has remarkably more than doubled since the beginning of 2020.

Show Hide The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers Avoid direct, unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals when visiting live markets in affected areas Avoid eating raw or undercooked animal products and exercise care when handling raw meat, milk or animal organs to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods. Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit \u2013 but not eliminate \u2013 the risks, provided they are used correctly. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. It is also warning that travellers from Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand who develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath within 14 days of returning the UK should contact the NHS by phone. Justin McCurry\n\nTwo GP practices were closed on Tuesday for cleaning over coronavirus fears, but are now open with some disruption to appointments.

Varndean school has written to the parents of its 1,300 pupils, the Argus reported. Varndean said somebody connected to the school had been told by Public Heath England (PHE) to self-isolate for 14 days.\n\nQuick guide What is the coronavirus and should we be worried? Show Hide What is the virus causing illness in Wuhan? It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city. What other coronaviruses have there been? New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples \u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. What are the symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus? The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health. Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another? China\u2019s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 12 February there are now 45,182 confirmed cases and 1,115 deaths. There are cases in 28 other countries outside China, with deaths recorded in one case in Hong Kong, and one case in the Philippines. The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend. One of the other four confirmed cases is being treated at the HCID unit at the Royal Free hospital in north London, and the two Chinese nationals who tested positive for Coronavirus in York are being treated at the HCID centre in Newcastle. Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts? We don\u2019t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won\u2019t know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The NHS advises that people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP\u2019s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others. Is this a pandemic and should we panic? Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is \u201cthe worldwide spread of a disease\u201d. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO\u2019s list. There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.

It\u2019s on to South Carolina. It\u2019s on to win the Democratic nomination.\u201d\n\nWith more than 91% of New Hampshire precincts reporting, Sanders had taken 26% of the vote compared with Buttigieg\u2019s25%, with Senator Amy Klobuchar making a surprise surge into third place with 20%. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren appeared to place fourth, with the former vice-president Joe Biden in fifth, another disappointing result for the long-favoured frontrunner following last week\u2019s chaotic Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe results in the second Democratic presidential nominating contest of the election year did not yield a clear frontrunner among the candidates, and highlighted the divided support for presidential candidates with rival ideologies for the future of the party and a post-Trump America. While Sanders and Warren are on the furthest left flank of the party, Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Biden are more moderate.\n\nIn his speech to supporters, 38-year-old Buttigieg, who is gay and campaigns with his husband, congratulated Sanders but then offered a thinly veiled criticism of his 78-year-old competitor, saying voters should not have to choose between \u201crevolution\u201d and the \u201cstatus quo\u201d.\n\n\u201cMost Americans don\u2019t see where they fit in that polarizing vision,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nNew Hampshire put an end to some long-shot candidacies. Businessman and political newcomer Andrew Yang had attracted a small but loyal following with his signature policy offering Americans a universal basic income, but said the numbers were not there for him to claim a path to the nomination, calling it \u201cbitterly disappointing\u201d.\n\nThe Colorado senator Michael Bennet also ended his campaign on Tuesday night, with Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, expected to suspend his on Wednesday.\n\nThat would leave eight candidates still in the race to become the Democratic presidential candidate to take on Donald Trump in the November election. While the Democratic field once boasted an historically diverse choice of candidates, it has become more white and male as it has narrowed.\n\nAfter more than a year of campaigning, hundreds of events and millions of dollars spent, the New Hampshire primary came just over a week after the Iowa Democratic caucuses, which ended in chaos over the reporting of the results. No clear single victor has been officially declared.\n\nSpeaking to her supporters on Tuesday, Warren said it had been a good night for Sanders and Buttigieg, and congratulated Klobuchar on \u201cshowing just how wrong the pundits can be when they count a woman out\u201d.\n\nBut she also highlighted that it was still early days in the race \u2013 just \u201ctwo states in, with 55 states and territories to go\u201d \u2013 and once again attempted to cast herself as the candidate who can \u201cunite this party and this country\u201d.\n\nQ&A What are the primaries? Show Hide The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and outlying territories, by which each party selects its presidential nominee. The goal for presidential candidates is to amass a majority of delegates, whose job it is to choose the nominee at the party\u2019s national convention later in the year. In some states, delegates are awarded on a winner-take-all basis; other states split their delegates proportionally among top winners.\n\nAfter her strong performance at a televised debate on Friday, Klobuchar surged to third place, after placing fifth in Iowa, where she had devoted the majority of her resources.\n\n\u201cHello America, my name is Amy Klobuchar and I will beat Donald Trump,\u201d the senator told a crowd of about 400 people in New Hampshire. \u201cMy heart is full tonight \u2026 While there are still ballots left to count, we have beaten the odds every step of the way.\u201d\n\nAnticipating his disappointing result, Biden headed to South Carolina hours before the results were released.\n\nBurritos, bagels and $16K worth of sushi: how 2020 Democrats are feeding their staff Read more\n\nHis campaign is banking on strong support from black voters \u2013 who remember him fondly for his role in Obama\u2019s historic presidency \u2013 in South Carolina, which votes at the end of the month.

We\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\n\nAfter a lackluster turnout in Iowa, the New Hampshire primary yielded much better news for Democrats.\n\nWith 90% of the estimated vote reporting, the vote tally had already surpassed 2016\u2019s 250,983, according to NBC News, and was approaching 2008\u2019s record of 288,672 voters.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2016 win was attributed, in part, to an enthusiasm gap, with some Barack Obama voters staying home instead of voting for Hillary Clinton. After Iowa fears had mounted that Democratic voters might again be less enthused by their choices, but New Hampshire\u2019s turnout is a source of encouragement.\n\nTrump, who faces no serious challenger for his party\u2019s nomination, easily won the New Hampshire Republican primary on Tuesday night. The president mocked the Democratic candidates, saying Warren was having a \u201creally bad night\u201d and asking why billionaire candidate Tom Steyer had \u201cgot only 3% of the Vote in New Hampshire\u201d despite spending millions of dollars of his own money on his campaign.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elizabeth Warren answers questions in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on Monday. Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nDespite Sanders\u2019 win, it was a very good night for Buttigieg and Klobuchar, who came much closer to his tally than expected. For days Democratic strategists had viewed Sanders as the heavy favourite to win New Hampshire. He won the state in 2016, beating Clinton by 22 points, or 56,838 votes.\n\nButtigieg has argued throughout his campaign stops that a strong showing in New Hampshire would cement his frontrunner status in the primary field.\n\nQ&A What are the New Hampshire primaries? Show Hide Most states hold primary elections, in which voters go to a polling place, mail in their ballots or otherwise vote remotely for a presidential nominee. These are much simpler than caucuses, which are hours-long meetings with multiple rounds of balloting. The first caucuses took place in Iowa on 3 February. Donald Trump won the Republican contest by a landslide, but the Democratic vote ended in chaos, with Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg both emerging as winners in a contest that was too close to call.\n\nNew Hampshire traditionally hosts the first primaries of the election year and has done so since 1920. All eyes will be on the competitive Democratic primary to see which candidate comes out on top. There will also be a Republican primary, though as Trump faces no serious competition, he is expected to win that contest by a huge margin.\n\nBut one person was conspicuously absent. Looming over the race was fellow candidate and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire who decided to completely forgo New Hampshire and all other early primary states to instead invest heavily in the crucial set of Super Tuesday states that vote on 3 March \u2013 an unconventional and risky strategy.\n\nAnother centrist, who banked on a poor performance from Biden in the early states to validate his own decision to run for the presidency, Bloomberg\u2019s candidacy throws another curveball into the still crowded field.\n\nEric Goldman, a veteran Democratic strategist, said the real test in the 2020 Democratic primary contest would come in a few weeks, with the Nevada caucuses on 22 February and the South Carolina primary on the 29th.\n\n\u201cThe big question mark that is outstanding and will be outstanding for the next couple of weeks is how any of these candidates do when black people show up to vote,\u201d Goldman said.\n\nJoe Biden comes out swinging in New Hampshire \u2013 but is it too late?

Instead, it will require internet companies such as Facebook and Google to publish explicit statements setting out which content and behaviour they deem to be acceptable on their sites. The media regulator will then ensure internet businesses enforce these standards \u201cconsistently and transparently\u201d.\n\nThe culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, promised that changes to the proposals would guarantee free speech for adults online and only target larger internet businesses. However, some tech start-up groups warned that it would still place an enormous burden on smaller businesses to police content that is potentially harmful but not illegal.\n\nAmong the proposals announced on Wednesday, it was revealed:\n\nAny business that enables the sharing of user-generated content \u2013 such as online comments or video uploads \u2013 is likely to be affected by the new rules on reducing online harms, with hundreds of thousands of British companies affected.\n\nInternet businesses will be required to publish annual transparency reports explaining what harmful content they have removed and how they are meeting their standards.\n\nThe government wants companies to bring back age verification for certain websites, following an abandoned attempt to introduce it last year to restrict access to online pornography.\n\nThe plan to require regulation has already raised concerns among the publishers of major newspapers, with some outlets that have campaigned for the legislation as a way of curtailing the power of internet companies fearful that their own news website comment sections could now be regulated for online harms. Ministers have previously reassured traditional publishers that they will be excluded from the legislation.\n\nThe announcement was made in the government\u2019s response to a consultation over the online harms white paper, unveiled last April.

The goal is that platforms which say they remove such content, and are thus safe for children to be active on, are held to that promise; while platforms that focus on free speech over safety are equally clear about objectives.\n\nThose new regulations will apply only to companies that allow the sharing of user-generated content, the government says.\n\nProfile Melanie Dawes profile Show Hide Melanie Dawes is currently permanent secretary at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

The synod\u2019s final document called for the ordination of \u201cviri probati\u201d \u2013 married men of good standing \u2013 and for an increased role for women in the church.\n\nThe issue exploded into the open last month with the publication of a book, From the Depths of our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church, which included an essay by Benedict. \u201cI cannot keep silent,\u201d the former pope, 92, said in a vigorous defence of clerical celibacy.\n\nAmid furore over the book, Benedict later requested the removal of his name as the co-author with conservative cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea.\n\nAlthough any easing of the celibacy rule was expected to be limited to specific circumstances, traditionalists feared it would inevitably lead to an end to the bar on married priests. Some said the proposal was heretical.\n\nProgressives had hoped that Francis would back change, but the pope made his views clear last year when he told reporters: \u201cPersonally I think that celibacy is a gift to the church. I would say that I do not agree with allowing optional celibacy, no.\u201d\n\nThe papal document defended the rights and legacies of Indigenous people and the environment in the Amazon. Francis said the rights of the poor should be respected, their cultural riches celebrated and the Amazon\u2019s natural beauty and life should be preserved.\n\nThe Amazon\u2019s ecological problems should not be separated from social ones, Francis said. He pleaded for justice for marginalised Indigenous people forced out of their homes due to illegal deforestation and mining, to the outskirts of cities marked by \u201can increase of xenophobia, sexual exploitation and human trafficking\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe businesses, national or international, which harm the Amazon and fail to respect the right of the original peoples to the land and its boundaries, and to self-determination and prior consent, should be called for what they are: injustice and crime.\u201d\n\nClare Dixon, of the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: \u201cThe pope is pointing to the Amazon as a microcosm of the crisis we are facing \u2013 with the fires, pollution and displacement we\u2019ve seen in the region showing the deadly interaction of poverty and the destruction of nature.\n\n\u201cBut Francis is also imploring us to listen to the wisdom of the people of the Amazon, insisting that we learn from the way they live with the environment rather than in competition with it.\u201d", "author": ["Harriet Sherwood", "Peter Stanford"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/12/essex-lorry-deaths-suspect-granted-extradition-appeal", "published": "2020-02-12T11:36:28", "title": "Essex lorry deaths suspect granted extradition appeal", "text": "A man wanted in the UK in connection with the deaths of 39 Vietnamese people found in a refrigerated shipping container in Essex has been granted permission in Dublin to appeal against his extradition.\n\nMr Justice Donald Binchy at Dublin\u2019s high court accepted arguments raised by Eamonn Harrison\u2019s defence team related to the issuing of a European arrest warrant.

As the clock strikes 11pm on Friday, the UK is officially divorced from the EU and will begin trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK\u2019s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours. Here\u2019s a run-through the beginning, the middle and the end. Brefusal The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain\u2019s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a \u201cdeep-seated hostility\u201d towards the European project. Brentry Sir Edward Heath signs the accession treaty giving entry to the EEC in an official ceremony that was accompanied by a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.\n\nLisa O'Carroll Referendum The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted \"yes\". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. 'Give us our money back' Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the \"iron lady\" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand \u201cour own money back\u201d claiming for every \u00a32 contributed we get only \u00a31 back\u201d despite being one of the \u201cthree poorer\u201d members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party. The Bruges speech Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in \u201cembryo\u201d. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. The cold war ends Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. 'No, no, no' Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was \u2018no, no, no\u2019 to what she saw as Delors\u2019 continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered \u201cUp yours Delors\u201d front page. Black Wednesday A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The single market On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of \u201ca single market without barriers \u2013 visible or invisible \u2013 giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most prosperous people\". Maastricht treaty Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory. Repairing the relationship Tony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers' rights. Ukip Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. \u201cOur interests are best served by not being a member of this club,\u201d he said in his maiden speech. \u201cThe level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.\u201d The euro Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro. EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club. Migrant crisis Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to \u201ccockroches\u201d by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as \u201cHow many more can we take?\u201d and \u201cCalais crisis: send in the dogs\u201d. David Cameron returns with reform package. Brexit referendum\n\nBritain leaves the EU\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in a notice issued after article 50 was invoked, the commission said: \u201cThe commission has taken note of the fact that a number of UK nationals among its staff have requested or may request a change towards a different first nationality. These changes are of an exceptional nature and therefore deserve a specific handling.\n\n\u201cAs a consequence, staff members from the United Kingdom who declare a change of nationality after 29 March 2017 shall still be considered to have kept the UK nationality as first nationality for the purpose of ensuring a balanced representation of staff within the commission, notably at middle-management and senior management level,\u201d said an official notice.\n\nThis is to ensure staff nationalities are in proportion to the membership of the union.\n\nUK nationals in the commission were not the only Britons to have sought security in dual EU-UK nationality.\n\nLast month, it emerged that 1,403 British nationals in Belgium had naturalised and have Belgian passports, up from 506 in 2016 and 127 in 2015.\n\nThis is part of an EU-wide trend, with more than 350,000 UK citizens living in Britain or a member state opting for dual nationality as a post-Brexit insurance policy.", "author": ["Lisa O'Carroll", "Cas Mudde"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/12/rose-mcgowan-natalie-portman-oscars-dress-protest-female-directors", "published": "2020-02-12T11:22:33", "title": "Rose McGowan: Natalie Portman's Oscars dress protest 'deeply offensive'", "text": "Activist and actor Rose McGowan has labelled Natalie Portman a \u201cfraud\u201d for wearing a dress to the Oscars embroidered with the names of female film-makers including Greta Gerwig and Lulu Wang who were passed over for best director nominations.\n\nIn a post on Facebook, McGowan said Portman had made \u201cthe kind of protest that gets rave reviews from the mainstream media\u201d but was \u201cmore like an actress acting the part of someone who cares.

She said Portman had only been directed twice by women (including her self-directed film A Tale of Love and Darkness). In fact, Portman has worked with Mira Nair on the short film compilation New York, I Love You, as well as on the Rebecca Zlotowski-directed Planetarium.\n\nPortman\u2019s company, Handsomecharlie Films, has participated in seven completed films to date, including the romcom No Strings Attached and the thriller Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Portman\u2019s A Tale of Love and Darkness is the only female-directed film on its list, while Lynne Ramsay left Jane Got a Gun and was replaced by Gavin O\u2019Connor.\n\nMcGowan, who published a memoir, Brave, about her alleged experience with Harvey Weinstein in 2018, wrote about Portman: \u201cYou are the problem. Lip service is the problem \u2026 I am singling you out because you are the latest in a long line of actresses who are acting the part of a woman who cares about other women. Actresses who supposedly stand for women, but in reality do not do much at all.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 3:27 Biggest night in Hollywood: key moments from the Oscars \u2013 video\n\nPortman has not yet responded to the statement.", "author": ["Andrew Pulver"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/12/caped-crusaders-how-little-women-lost-the-oscars-but-won-fashion", "published": "2020-02-12T11:00:30", "title": "Caped crusaders: how Little Women lost the Oscars \u2013 but won fashion", "text": "In the end \u2013 after six nominations, and a controversial omission for Greta Gerwig in the director category \u2013 the only Oscar that Little Women took home was awarded to Jacqueline Durran for best costume design. Not a truly happy ending to the story of Gerwig\u2019s project, but perhaps an appropriate one nonetheless. Because the story of this film was that Little Women lost the awards season, but it won fashion.\n\nI am writing this from New York fashion week, where the spirit of the March sisters is alive and kicking both in the autumn collections on the catwalks and among the fashionista finery being showcased on the front row. That scene in Little Women, where the sisters stroll arm in arm in wool capes over long dresses, with crisp pie-crust collars and sturdy lace-up boots? That is the exact look that you will find striding over the crosswalks of Hudson Yards or Chelsea to the show venues, five minutes before showtime, at any point this week. (Give or take the odd Starbucks takeout coffee cup, and a few Bottega Veneta bags, obviously. Hey, I\u2019m not in charge of continuity here, OK?) And on the catwalk, capes are already making a strong bid for next autumn\u2019s wishlist.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Capes in Little Women and on the Caroline Herrera catwalk, NYFW, AW20. Composite: 2019 CTMG, Inc/Guardian design team\n\nAt Adam Lippes, the capes were soft and romantic \u2013 a floor-length claret wool version was layered over a calico dress in washed-out peach, with a frilled collar \u2013 while at Carolina Herrera, they looked crisp and urban in camel paired with white. This dual identity is precisely what makes Little Women dressing such an unexpectedly appealing trend.\n\nThese are clothes that have a dreamy, dress-up quality but translate remarkably easily into a 21st-century wardrobe. Spotted on one British fashion editor here at NYFW who is already working the trend is the oversized Scarlett boyfriend blazer, \u00a3180, by the Kentish Town-based London brand Palones, the wide sleeves of which convert to a cape style with a row of buttons. A practical touch of which I feel sure Jo March would approve.\n\nGerwig\u2019s take on Little Women painted Amy, the most fashion-loving and apparently frivolous of the March sisters, in a sympathetic light. That Florence Pugh as Amy was the only actor to receive an acting nomination at the Oscars is another signpost of how fashion-friendly this interpretation of Louisa May Alcott\u2019s book is. Amy March gives her more famous sister Jo a run for her money in the contest to be fashion\u2019s current muse. Several looks from the Florence-Pugh-as-Amy wardrobe created by Durran have made their way on to fashion\u2019s most influential new-season moodboards. The ornate, V-shaped bodice of the blouse and pinafore that Amy wears in the scene where she smartly schools Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in the economic realities of marriage from a woman\u2019s perspective echoed through the catwalks this week. At Adam Lippes, there were yoke-shaped frills on an oatmeal sweater with a lace collar; on the Tory Burch catwalk, Natalia Vodianova wore a black blouse with a V-shaped front panel edged in white piping, tied in a neat bow at the throat, paired with a long skirt over boots.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Florence Pugh as Amy wearing a yoke-shaped bodice and a similar shape at the Adam Lippes show, NYFW, AW20. Composite: Sony Pictures/SplashNews.com/Guardian design team\n\nThe outfit worn by Amy in the film\u2019s beach scene has also made a serious impression on fashion. A mididress fastened with a long row of covered buttons from collarbone to waist, paired with sturdy boots, is a front-row go-to look right now. For next season, Kate Spade\u2019s new collection, shown this week, featured a lemon yellow dress with a pretty row of tiny buttons. The new New York show by Brock Collection, designed by Laura Vassar and Kris Brock, gave excellent contemporary Little Women vibes throughout, particularly with the long tiered day dresses in the kind of sheeny fabric that makes a lovely, rustly sound effect when you walk, which was teamed with flat riding boots.\n\nAs for the sturdy boots \u2013 at this point, dear reader, if you will allow me to break off from the Little Women narrative for one moment \u2013 I would like to share with you a public service announcement. I have found the absolutely perfect, sublimely comfortable just-enough-of-a-heel block heel lace-up ankle boots, in Marks & Spencer for \u00a365. They come in stone- and black-coloured leather or tan suede. You won\u2019t regret it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Little Women\u2019s lace collars and at the Zimmermann show, NYFW, AW20. Composite: Allstar/Columbia Pictures/Guardian design team\n\nWhere were we? Ah, yes, the eyelet collar, of course. The white lace contrast collar \u2013 think Peter Pan, but a little bit extra \u2013 is incoming on style from all directions, being not only a Little Women staple but also the star of last month\u2019s super-chic Chanel haute couture show. Leandra Medine, the founder of the Man Repeller site-cum-brand and all-round modern media mogul, wore a super-sheer, dinner-plate-sized white lace Chlo\u00e9 collar over an olive green sweater and a camel coat to attend the Tory Burch show. Medine was seated right next to Gabi Butler and Lexi Brumback, real-life cheerleading champions and the stars of Netflix\u2019s cult documentary Cheer, who are very much the NYFW attendees everyone is falling over themselves to sit with.\n\nLittle Women dressing is the new power dressing, it seems. At the beautiful Zimmermann show, the morning after the Oscars, a delicate scalloped ivory lace collar sat in face-framing contrast over a rich purple velvet waistcoat.\n\nBeing Jo March: Little Women finally has an ending grown women deserve | Josephine Tovey Read more\n\nThe litmus test for the power of Little Women will be whether the ubiquitous boxy blazer can be usurped by the drummer-boy style jackets favoured by Jo in the film. Slightly shrunken jackets nipped at the waist have made the first stage of the transition, from screen to catwalk, elegant in black velvet with a peaked shoulder at the Tory Burch show. If they win over fashion audiences, they could be a box-office hit. Little Women may not have been the toast of Hollywood on Sunday night, but it has New York fashion week cheering in the aisles.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

South Cubbington Wood, which has been a feature in her life since she was a child, will be partially destroyed to make way for HS2.\n\n\u201cI was brought up here. It\u2019s always been home,\u201d the 70-year-old retired teacher said after walking past tractors camped just outside the ancient woodland. In the past 10 years, Guiot and a local campaign group, Cubbington Action Group Against HS2, have handed in petitions, gone on protests and attended select committee hearings to make arguments for alternative routes, such as building a tunnel underneath the woodlands; these plans were dismissed.\n\nThe news is all the harder to take because just six miles up the road, the potential impact of HS2 on a local golf club was \u201cvirtually eliminated\u201d following five years of negotiations. When HS2 was initially proposed, the route would have run across the eastern end of Kenilworth Golf Club course, but it has since been changed to run further east.\n\nThe golf club declined to comment, but its original petition on the subject read: \u201cThe loss of one hole on an 18-hole golf course will make the operation of the course unsustainable. Golf is a game played over 18 holes.\u201d\n\nFor some campaigners, the success of that approach contrasts sharply with South Cubbington Wood \u2013 and highlights a misguided set of priorities for the government. \u201cThey\u2019re telling us on one hand that woodland and nature is good for mental health, and then they\u2019re doing this. It\u2019s upsetting so many people,\u201d Guiot said. The woodlands, which are free and have far more biodiversity, are far more important than golf courses, she said.\n\nPeter Delow, who lives a ten minute walk from South Cubbington Wood, doesn\u2019t believe it should be framed as a choice between the woodlands or the golf course. The 71-year-old retired engineer has long argued that the high speed rail line that will travel through the countryside between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds should be cancelled entirely.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Cubbington Action Group Against HS2 has set up a protest camp in the woods after its arguments for alternative routes were all dismissed. Photograph: John Robertson/The Guardian\n\n\u201cOver the last ten years, I\u2019ve read countless documents on the project and written 400 blog posts on the matter and on all the grounds I\u2019ve looked at it, from transport, the environment and financial perspective, it doesn\u2019t actually make any sense,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Delow has accepted that his efforts to stop the project through parliament have failed, a group of activists have set up a protest camp to stop South Cubbington Wood being destroyed. Among the group was Martin Newman, an accountant, who said that as well as the environmental impact, costwise the project has gotten \u201cout of control\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe cost has jumped from \u00a356bn in 2015 to as much as \u00a3106bn as of this month. It is a complete waste of money. We need investment in infrastructure, but it\u2019s concentrating that investment in a narrow area,\u201d he said, pointing to the fact the northern part of the railway line will likely be paused.\n\nBut for Lucy, who has worked for the past 15 years as a headhunter in global mega-projects, the railway is key to bridging the north-south divide and would be hugely beneficial for local businesses. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ageing infrastructure, as a lot of reports show. It costs a lot more to upgrade all the existing Victorian infrastructure than to build new routes.\u201d\n\nThe 37-year-old, who lives in Leamington Spa, added: \u201cWe used to be the forefront of the infrastructure, but if we don\u2019t invest, we will start to fall behind.\u201d She pointed to China, Japan and some European high speed rail as examples to emulate to kickstart the local economies in the north and Midlands, especially after Brexit.\n\nDarren Galloway, who is self-employed and lives in Nuneaton, echoed Lucy\u2019s points. The 40-year-old said: \u201cUnfortunately there are a lot of outdated and very narrow minded views from residents which do not allow for the development of the country let alone the area, for the benefit of the future generations.\u201d\n\nBut Penny McGregor, among the protestors at South Cubbington Wood, said there wasn\u2019t enough focus on the impact HS2 will have on local farmers. The high speed railway will go through a chunk of her father\u2019s farmland, which has impacted him both emotionally and financially, she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Martin Newman (above) said cost wise the project has gotten \u2018out of control\u2019.

Many farmers are in distress; there is a lot of depression and anxiety associated with this project,\u201d she said.\n\nMcGregor said that when she heard the news that the government had given the green light to the project, she felt like there was a dagger through her heart. \u201cIt\u2019s just a train for goodness sake, it\u2019s just a train.

No one would touch it, so they had to use a cherry picker to move it. But that\u2019s not the worst of it, Scollick says: \u201cI stripped the cover off one once and it looked like somebody \u2026\u201d \u201cDied,\u201d interjects Allsopp.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say you need a strong stomach to be in the mattress recycling game. Which Scollick and Allsopp have, along with several million pounds\u2019 worth of equipment in their Coventry warehouse. I have come to see Circom, their mattress recycling firm, at work. It\u2019s a dirty but noble enterprise: Circom is one of only a handful of recyclers tackling the UK\u2019s ever-growing mattress problem.\n\nThe UK threw away more than 7m mattresses in 2017, the vast majority of which went straight to landfill. Zero Waste Scotland has estimated that if the 600,000 mattresses Scotland throws away every year were stacked on top of each other, the pile would be more than 100 times taller than Ben Nevis. Flytipping is another huge area of concern: English councils spend \u00a358m a year on clear-up, with mattresses among the most commonly illegally dumped items. According to the National Bed Federation (NBF), only about 19% of mattresses are recycled. The reason? They are a nightmare to recycle \u2013 it\u2019s the springs. \u201cThey\u2019re a machine killer,\u201d says Scollick.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just a British problem. Mattresses are a global environmental nightmare. The US throws away 18.2m mattresses a year, but there are only 56 facilities available to recycle them.\n\nChanging consumer behaviour is behind this ever-growing mattress mountain. Time was, you would change your mattress every eight to 10 years. But with online retailers offering more choice than ever, we have learned to expect better mattresses, and to replace them more frequently.\n\nThe development of roll-down technology \u2013 which allows mattresses to be packed into small, easily shippable boxes \u2013 has led to a plethora of start-ups targeting a $30bn international market. There are now at least 175 companies that will ship roll-down mattresses to your front door; one of the first movers in this space, the US firm Casper, was valued at $1.1bn in 2019.\n\nMost of these start-ups offer 100-day comfort guarantees, during which consumers can return their mattresses for a full refund if for any reason they are not up to scratch. Some, such as the US\u2019s Nectar, even offer a 365-day guarantee. Theoretically, consumers can cycle between these providers for high-quality mattresses at no cost: a Wall Street Journal reporter recently calculated that if she took advantage of all the offers available, she would be able to sleep on a free mattress for eight years.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The dream of the perfect mattress is fuelling a consumer boom \u2013 with unimagined environmental repurcusions\n\nThere is evidence that some consumers are gaming the system. A standard mattress retailer would aim for a return rate of less than 5%, says Jessica Alexander, of the NBF. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of 20% return rates, or even more, for some of these online retailers,\u201d she adds. Not all consumers are behaving selfishly: some may be genuinely dissatisfied with their purchase. \u201cThe traditional way of buying a mattress was to go into a shop, lie down, discuss your needs with a salesperson, then buy a mattress,\u201d Alexander says. With the online companies, \u201cpeople are buying them, finding they weren\u2019t as comfortable as they hoped, and sending them back\u201d.\n\nThat was the case for Cara (not her real name), a 26-year-old marketing executive from Florida. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have bought a mattress without the guarantee,\u201d she says. She bought a $900 mattress in 2018, before returning it for a full refund. \u201cUltimately, it just wasn\u2019t that much more comfortable than my old mattress, which I had held on to just in case. I didn\u2019t realise that returning it would mean that it was going to be potentially thrown out. If I\u2019d known that, I probably would have hesitated about buying it.\u201d\n\nSome online providers have arrangements with care homes or hospitals to collect lightly used mattresses, re-cover them, and put them back into use. Others send them for recycling. But many will, inevitably, end up in landfill. \u201cWe\u2019ve introduced a disposable mattress business model at a time when we probably should be moving in the exact opposite direction,\u201d says Alexander.\n\nIt is difficult to recycle the materials in a mattress because they aren\u2019t worth much on the secondary market. \u201cA lot of people would feel that there\u2019s value in the materials in a mattress,\u201d says David Fitzsimons, of the circular-economy experts Oakdene Hollins. \u201cBut, generally, that\u2019s not true.\u201d You may be able to get a few pounds for the metal springs in a mattress, but it\u2019s hard to find takers for the foam and fibre.\n\nBack at Circom, Allsopp and Scollick recycle about 60% of the mattresses they process, and hope to get that up to 100%. Loosening the regulations around fibre and foam would be a big help, so they can be reused in the same way that old carpets are processed for horse stabling.\n\nAs we tour the Circom plant, Allsopp asks me not to go into too much detail about the processes, lest its competitors steal their trade secrets. He needn\u2019t have worried \u2013 you\u2019d need an engineering degree to describe a machinery system this complex. And I\u2019m a literature graduate.\n\nSuffice to say, there is an enormous crusher that crunches the mattresses, before belching them into a series of chutes that suck the detritus out like a big vacuum cleaner, separating it into fibre and foam. At some point, magnets are involved, but they have to be kept up high so they don\u2019t destroy your mobile phone. The steel blades of the crusher have to be replaced every few weeks because they wear out so fast \u2013 there is an engineer whose job it is to weld the blades to make them more durable.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mattresses are processed at Circom\u2019s warehouse in Coventry\n\nI watch transfixed as a cherry-picker operator feeds mattresses into the machine as if they were fruit being fed into a blender. As the machine chomps bulky mattresses down in seconds, I think: this would be an excellent place to get rid of a body.\n\nMany companies claim to recycle mattresses. But by no means all operate legitimately. \u201cWe do everything according to the law,\u201d says Allsopp. He is a matter-of-fact, gruff presence. \u201cWe like the law.\u201d Unfortunately, Scollick notes: \u201cWherever waste is, there\u2019s criminality somewhere.\u201d\n\nThe pair encounter criminals on a regular basis: they call the warehouse, asking for mattresses for resale, or if they have any leftover foam they can purchase. You can spot the fraudsters easily, because they\u2019ll email from Gmail or Hotmail accounts, or call on mobiles. Allsopp says: \u201cI have to be careful about what I say; I don\u2019t want to start naming people because, basically, I\u2019m frightened of them. I don\u2019t want to wake up one morning and find that this place\u201d \u2013 he gestures at the building \u2013 \u201cis on fire.\u201d\n\nOne scam involves fraudsters posing as reputable mattress recyclers. They set up an official-looking website and start offering their services to residents and businesses. When people bite, the fraudsters collect the mattresses, pick the ones in good condition, replace the outer casing, and then wrap in new covers that often have the logo of a reputable manufacturer on it. These secondhand mattresses are then sold as new. \u201cSome of the mattresses you get from the general public are disgusting,\u201d warns Allsopp. \u201cIf you strip the outer polycotton layer off a mattress, underneath it\u2019s just a horror,\u201d Scollick agrees. \u201cThat, unsanitised, is going into supposedly brand-new mattresses.\u201d\n\nIt is easy to fall victim to mattress scammers: a member of Fitzsimons\u2019 own family was duped. \u201cI was agog!\u201d he says. \u201cIn spite of all my stories over the dinner table!\u201d A common scam involves a man with a van \u2013 often with the name of a reputable firm on the side \u2013 who goes door-to-door in residential neighbourhoods. He was meant to be delivering mattresses to a hotel, he\u2019ll say, but there was a problem with the order, and they have surplus, high-quality mattresses. There\u2019s no space back at the warehouse. Would you like to purchase them cheaply? \u201cIt works because people can\u2019t resist a bargain, and don\u2019t ask questions,\u201d Fitzsimons says.\n\nTo reassure anxious customers that it\u2019s all legitimate, salesmen will sometimes issue professional-looking paperwork, with false contact details. \u201cThese carefully wrapped mattresses are made to look as new, sometimes with fake branding and fire-resistant labels, when they are often actually worn-out, dirty and unhygienic mattresses destined for the tip,\u201d says councillor David Renard, of the Local Government Association. \u201cThese mattresses generally fail fire safety tests,\u201d he adds. \u201cMany victims won\u2019t realise they have been conned and could be sleeping on a potential death trap.\u201d\n\nAllsopp and Scollick have visited the warehouses from which the scammers operate. It is common for workers to run the minute they see them, mistaking them for Environment Agency officials. (It\u2019s the hi-vis jackets.) When they get inside the warehouses, it\u2019s a grim affair. \u201cThey were just spraying glue,\u201d says Allsopp of one rogue operator they stumbled across. \u201cThe smell from the glue \u2013 you were as high as a kite.\u201d In addition to the sites being illegal and unsafe, they possibly use trafficked workers. \u201cA lot of the staff don\u2019t speak English, so you\u2019re wondering if anything is wrong there,\u201d says Scollick.\n\nThe mattresses these criminals can\u2019t resell, they fly-tip \u2013 Circom has had mattresses dumped outside its warehouse \u2013 or dump in landfill. In some cases, fraudsters have been known to rent a shed from an unsuspecting landlord, fill it to the brim with mattresses \u2013 and scarper. \u201cThere are loads of fake companies out there filling up sheds,\u201d agrees Ray Bagnall, of Matt UK, another mattress recycler. \u201cDumping them on farms in Sussex or Essex.\u201d He was recently called to clear out a shed full of thousands of mattresses in Snowdonia.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sri Lankan customs customs officials inspect a container full of mattresses illegally imported into the island from Britain. Photograph: HANDOUT/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOur ever-growing used mattress problem is also being exported. In July 2019, 100 containers of British waste were found in the port of Colombo, Sri Lanka. They had been illegally sent there, under the guise of metal recycling. Allsopp pulls up a photograph of the containers on his computer. \u201cIf you look at what\u2019s in there, those are baled mattresses,\u201d he says, pointing to the screen. Many of the mattresses appear to be wrapped in distinctive green packaging. \u201cThose are the green bags that national retailers use to take mattresses back under their return scheme,\u201d Allsopp says. Which means that mattresses that were sent for recycling by major retailers have been illegally dumped in a foreign country.\n\nThe authorities are aware of the criminality in the industry, but don\u2019t have the resources or political wherewithal to deal with it. \u201cIt\u2019s the wild west at the moment,\u201d says Alexander. \u201cYes, there are a number of good mattress-recycling facilities out there, but they\u2019re limited.\u201d The Local Government Association would like to see tougher criminal penalties on flytipping, as well as more manufacturers offering take-back services for old mattresses.\n\nWithout action from regulators, the industry is trying to self-regulate. The National Bed Federation has a code of practice and accreditation system for genuine mattress recyclers: it audits facilities to check firms are compliant with the law and there\u2019s no exploitation of their workforce. The organisation also aims to divert 75% of new mattresses sold from landfill by 2028, and is encouraging manufacturers to consider eco-friendly designs, such as reusable mattresses that would be leased to consumers for a period of time, before being sent back, stripped and refreshed.\n\nFor now, though, it seems likely that mattress scamming will continue unchecked. Until that changes, consumers would do well to be wary of the fake mattresses flooding the market.

Show Hide What is the virus causing illness in Wuhan? It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city. What other coronaviruses have there been? New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples \u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. What are the symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus? The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health. Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another? China\u2019s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 12 February there are now 45,182 confirmed cases and 1,115 deaths. There are cases in 28 other countries outside China, with deaths recorded in one case in Hong Kong, and one case in the Philippines. The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend. One of the other four confirmed cases is being treated at the HCID unit at the Royal Free hospital in north London, and the two Chinese nationals who tested positive for Coronavirus in York are being treated at the HCID centre in Newcastle. Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts? We don\u2019t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won\u2019t know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The NHS advises that people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP\u2019s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others. Is this a pandemic and should we panic? Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is \u201cthe worldwide spread of a disease\u201d. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO\u2019s list. There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Sarah Boseley Health editor and Hannah Devlin\n\nPanic has set in across Hong Kong over the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 1,115 and infected over 45,000 across the world, mostly in China. A number of private clinics have closed temporarily after they ran out of masks. Hospital staff say they are running out of masks and protective clothing, prompting a strike last week that demanded the government close all its borders with China and provide adequate protective gear.\n\nThousands of people camped overnight early last week, braving chilly winds outside an outlet that had procured a supply of masks from the Middle East. Long queues quickly form in front of any shops where a fresh stock of necessities in short supply have arrived. People join if there is a queue just to grab what they can get hold on.\n\nOn Bonham Road on Wednesday morning, the few remaining items of rice and paper products were quickly snapped up, leaving most customers disappointed. A staff member said: \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s a war on \u2013 things fly off the shelves as soon as we restock.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about flour? You can make pancakes then,\u201d said an elderly lady with a smile.\n\nJoseph Cheng, a retired political scientist at the City University of Hong Kong, said the panic buying stemmed from a deep level of distrust in the government, which is seen as incompetent in handling the crisis.

Of course,\u201d said Maduro, who blames Venezuela\u2019s woes on an \u201ceconomic war\u201d being waged by Washington. \u201cBut Venezuela is not a country of famine.\u201d\n\nThose on the frontline of the crisis tell a different story.\n\nIn Bol\u00edvar, Venezuela\u2019s largest state, doctors and social workers said they were seeing more and more severely malnourished children.\n\n\u201cThere has been an incredible spike in malnutrition cases in the last one and a half or two years,\u201d said one ER doctor who asked not to be named because of the politically sensitive nature of the emergency. \u201cWe have so many children suffering severe protein-calorie malnutrition.\u201d\n\nCarlos Hern\u00e1ndez Acosta, a paediatrician in the state capital, Ciudad Bol\u00edvar, said the fact infant mortality rates were no longer falling was in itself a tragedy.\n\n\u201cBut for them to be going up is unimaginable,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez added.\n\n\u201cI feel profound anger.

My daughter! Mummy!\u201d she cried, clutching her 33-year-old mother, Alexandra, for support.\n\nOn the other side of the door, doctors raced to save Luciannys, who was dangerously dehydrated after more than 25 bouts of diarrhoea that day.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in pretty bad shape,\u201d one doctor admitted as colleagues tapped on Luciannys\u2019s cheeks to stop her slipping into unconsciousness.\n\nTo witness the almost unthinkable deprivation putting the lives of Venezuelan children at risk, drive two miles east from the hospital to an abandoned love motel called the Hotel Imperial where a dozen destitute families have made their homes.\n\nThere, in the wreckage of what was once Room 14, lives Yenni Galindo, a 29-year-old single mother of seven who is, somehow, raising her family on a monthly wage of just 800,000 bol\u00edvares ($11) \u2013 a little over one dollar per person per month.\n\nNone of Yenni\u2019s children are in school \u2013 she cannot afford the uniforms \u2013 and she often struggles to feed them despite working as a cook in a local market.\n\nSuch hardship almost proved fatal.\n\nLast July Yenni\u2019s youngest child, eight-month-old Jes\u00fas, was rushed to the Ruiz y P\u00e1ez hospital where he too was diagnosed with severe malnutrition and admitted for nine days. When he reached the ER he weighed 5.4kg (12lb) \u2013 far below the average of 8-10kg (18-22lb).\n\n\u201cIt was awful. He was a chubby little kid and suddenly he became so weak. All skin and bones,\u201d his mother said outside their dank room in the derelict motel.\n\nMedical records suggest Jes\u00fas was suffering from marasmus, a type of malnutritioncaused by a general lack of nutrients. According to doctors, food shortages and hyperinflation have made the condition increasingly common in today\u2019s Venezuela.\n\nBut doctors are also noticing more and more cases of another potentially fatal type of malnutrition called kwashiorkor, which causes swelling in the legs and face and is a result of the inadequate consumption of protein.\n\nDoctors blame the growing prevalence of that condition on impoverished families feeding their babies rice cream or wheat flour, cornmeal or spaghetti mixed with water, instead of baby formula, which they cannot afford, or breastfeeding for which many malnourished mothers feel too weak.\n\nSix months after his brush with death, Jes\u00fas is on the mend despite losing so much muscle mass that he has yet to walk.\n\n\u201cMy dream is for them to be able to study and find work,\u201d Yenni said of her seven children who share the same filthy mattress in the waterless hotel.\n\nYaretzi will never get that chance.\n\nShe was born in El Callao, an edgy gold rush town in Bol\u00edvar, on 14 October last year, along with a twin sister called Yaritzi.\n\nRelatives say the sisters were born healthy, even if Yaretzi was slightly underweight at 2.2 kg (4.85lb).\n\nUnable to afford baby formula \u2013 now far beyond the means of most Venezuelan families \u2013 Yaretzi\u2019s mother and grandmother instead fed her rice cream. Deprived of the nutrients she needed to thrive, Yaretzi faded.\n\nBy the time she was admitted to the Ruiz y P\u00e1ez hospital on the night of Sunday 12 January \u2013 limp, feverish and with a worryingly low haemoglobin count and a severe skin infection \u2013 Yaretzi stood little chance.\n\nDoctors gave her a blood transfusion in the hope of saving her. But four days after being admitted, at around 11am on 16 January, Yaretzi\u2019s short life came to an end.\n\nVenezuela crisis takes deadly toll on buckling health system Read more\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t make it,\u201d her mother said as she tended to Yaretzi\u2019s twin, just metres from the bed on which her sister had died.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Yaretzi\u2019s fragile corpse was loaded into a green SUV and driven four hours to El Callao.

The 75-year-old is keen to go back to his beloved house near Tintern Abbey, but Monmouthshire county council has been unable to arrange any care for him for five months. \u201cI want to get back to living a normal life \u2026 or as normal life as I can,\u201d he says. \u201cI miss my friends dropping in and going on the bus to get my shopping. I can run my own affairs from home \u2013 I\u2019m not used to people holding my hand.\u201d\n\nJones, a former engineer, was admitted to hospital after a fall and then moved to Castle Court residential home in October.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get him home ever since,\u201d says his social worker, Lynne Wheadon. \u201cHe\u2019s done really well but he does need help with things like washing and meals.\u201d\n\nThe gap between young and old has turned Britain into a dysfunctional family | John Harris Read more\n\nHis cousin, Dee Jones, a retired gerontologist, is frustrated that he has been waiting for months. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing much wrong with him physically apart from being sedentary and left in bed for too long,\u201d she says. \u201cThe longer somebody isn\u2019t autonomous, the more dependent they become. He used to walk down a hill to catch the bus to go into Chepstow every day. Now he uses a walking frame.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s predicament illustrates the human crisis blighting the final years of people\u2019s lives and putting at risk the finances of councils across Wales. The problem has become so acute that the Welsh government is for the first time considering introducing a \u201csocial care levy\u201d to plug the gap. This would see income taxes rise by at least 1.5% under new devolved powers, which could raise \u00a3300m a year.\n\nLast month Monmouthshire revealed it had a near \u00a34m deficit, amid rocketing demand for adult and children\u2019s care services. The Conservative-controlled council hopes to make up the shortfall by selling council assets and applying for one-off grants from the Welsh government. But council papers warn it needs to find another \u00a35.5m in the next financial year to meet rising social care costs.\n\nPenny Jones, Monmouthshire\u2019s cabinet member for social services, fears what the future might hold, with the council currently unable to arrange 700 hours of care. \u201cWe are struggling to keep afloat,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are a rural county and we have the fastest-growing population of older people in Wales.\u201d The county has seen a 20% increase in over-65s and over-85s since 2011.\n\n\u201cOur main problem is home care, especially in rural areas. It\u2019s hard to get and keep carers when they earn more stacking shelves in Tesco. We are trying everything but we are strapped,\u201d says Jones.\n\nThese problems are not just confined to Monmouthshire. Wales is the country with the oldest population in the UK, with the number of over-75s due to increase by 70% and over-85s expected to double by 2040. These demographic pressures coupled with rising numbers of children in care and a decade of austerity \u2013 which has seen Welsh councils lose 20% of their funding \u2013 have pushed many councils into the red. According to the Welsh Local Government Association, 17 councils have overspent by \u00a335m this year to meet increasing social care bills.\n\nPrivately, senior council officers speculate grimly about which council will become the first in Wales to follow in the footsteps of Northamptonshire, which in effect declared itself bankrupt in 2018 after it revealed it could not meet its financial obligations. \u201cI can think of a handful of authorities that are running multimillion-pound deficits due to social care,\u201d says John Rae, the Welsh LGA\u2019s director of resources. These include Gwynedd and Flintshire which have projected overspends of \u00a33.8m and \u00a31.6m respectively for 2019-20. \u201cCouncils are facing unrelenting demand in social care and children services,\u201d he says.\n\nAlthough the Welsh government has increased overall funding for local authorities by \u00a36bn in the next financial year, councils are still struggling to keep up with the demand for social care, which is increasing by 5.5% every year. \u201cIt certainly helps but it is not meeting all the pressures on local government. Councils need \u00a3254m extra for all services in the next financial year, with social care making up \u00a3140m of that,\u201d adds Rae. \u201cThe Welsh government has given them an additional \u00a3184m for all services.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barry Priest, who has been in Chepstow community hospital since October. \u2018My wife would like me to be at home. I see her almost every day which is some consolation, but it\u2019s not the same as being at home.\u2019 Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures\n\nBack in Monmouthshire, Barry Priest in Chepstow community hospital has been waiting to go home to his wife, Nina, since October. \u201cMy wife would like me to be at home,\u201d he says. \u201cI see her almost every day which is some consolation \u2026 but it\u2019s not the same as being at home.\u201d\n\nThe 87-year-old retired farm worker was moved to the hospital after he was treated for a fall at the Royal Gwent hospital in Newport in July. The council\u2019s social care team has been unable to find carers to meet his needs, which have grown, in part due to the length of his stay.\n\n\u201cWhen he first went in, he could walk,\u201d says Nina. \u201cBut he goes from the bed into the chair and from the chair into the bed. They wheel him to the toilet because they are short-staffed. Anybody would lose their legs like that.\u201d\n\nShe says her husband shouldn\u2019t have to spend what remains of his life in an unfamiliar environment. \u201cIt just drags on and on. He\u2019s clear-headed. He knows what he wants. He just loves his home \u2013 the older you are, the more precious it is,\u201d she says. \u201cI miss him. When you are on your own, you just rattle around the house.\u201d\n\nIt is not only a personal tragedy for the Priests. Barry is occupying a desperately needed hospital bed in the midst of a particularly tough NHS winter crisis in Wales, with waiting times in A&E hitting record levels and operations being cancelled. Social worker Annette Brady, the service manager at Chepstow community hospital, says it is the worst it has ever been during her 20-year career. \u201cIt is desperate. We had a red alert on Friday. There were no beds in the Royal Gwent hospital. They had people in A&E or outside in ambulances,\u201d she says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the capacity to open up our beds but we do have old people here waiting for care packages.\u201d\n\nOne in three over-80s 'provide vital unpaid care for loved ones' in UK Read more\n\nThe latest figures show there were 125 elderly people waiting for social care in Welsh hospitals in December \u2013 an increase of 39% on the same month in 2009.\n\nThe Welsh government is well aware of these mounting pressures and cannot wait for Boris Johnson\u2019s vague social care plans, which could take at least five years to put in place. The health minister, Vaughan Gething, proposes to consult in the spring on options including a social care levy, which could be implemented after the assembly election next year. \u201cI\u2019m open to the idea of using our tax powers here in Wales,\u201d he says. \u201cI would like us to be in a position in the next Welsh parliament to change the way we provide social care and how we fund it.\u201d\n\nThis cannot come soon enough for families with loved ones stuck in hospitals and care homes. Nina feels her husband has been let down by a system he paid into his whole life. \u201cNobody should have to go through this,\u201d she says. \u201cHe started working at 14. He was in the marines. When a person is young, they do so much. But when they are old, the plate comes around and it is empty.\u201d", "author": ["Tom Wall"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/feb/12/most-romantic-car-free-itineraries-in-uk-valentines-day", "published": "2020-02-12T06:30:25", "title": "The most romantic car-free itineraries in the UK", "text": "Doune and Stirling\n\nCatch the 59 bus to Doune from Stirling (around half an hour by train from Edinburgh or Glasgow). Once there visit grey-walled Doune Castle (\u00a39/\u00a35.40), by the riverside. It\u2019s a beautiful place \u2013 even if you\u2019ve no interest in its film and TV connections \u2013 with views from the top of the walls across the leafy Teith valley. Much of the first season of the raunchy Outlander was filmed here and the time-travelling romantic fantasy returns to Amazon Prime for a fifth season this month. Actor Sam Heughan, who plays Jamie Fraser, has added to the castle\u2019s original audio guide narrated by the much-missed Terry Jones (the castle also starred in Monty Python and the Holy Grail). Afterwards, stop off at water-powered Deanston Distillery, one bus stop back towards Stirling. It\u2019s open all-year with hourly tours until 4pm (\u00a312.50 including a taster).\n\nStay Neoclassical Hotel Colessio (doubles from \u00a364 room only), not far from Stirling railway station.\n\nNext day Explore Stirling, especially atmospheric around Valentine\u2019s with its huge (and very different) castle (adult \u00a316, 5-15 \u00a39.60) rising out of the mist above the frosty trees and river.\n\nGlasgow to Mallaig\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Glenfinnan Viaduct. Photograph: Alamy\n\nThe West Highland Line, from Glasgow to the coast, is among the world\u2019s most spectacular train rides. Advance tickets start from \u00a317 each way for the epic five-hour journey to Mallaig, passing lochs and mountains, woods and villages. The railway runs beside Loch Lomond for 10 miles, then climbs to wild Rannoch Moor. The landscape gets even more breathtaking beyond Fort William and changeable weather simply makes the journey more dramatic. Watch out for waterfalls beside the tracks, stags on the hillside and herons flapping over the lochs. Finally, sea views with islands and curving sandy beaches mean you\u2019re arriving at Mallaig.\n\nStay The tartan-decked Moorings Guesthouse (doubles from \u00a390 B&B), five minutes\u2019 walk from Mallaig station, has free whisky, harbour views and Mallaig kippers for breakfast.\n\nNext day Pick up a picnic from the harbourside bakery opposite and consider taking a ferry to Skye (Britain\u2019s most romantic location, according to a 2018 Mills and Boon survey) for \u00a36 return. Otherwise, if you\u2019re heading back by train towards Glasgow, stop off for a few hours in Glenfinnan for walks by the loch and under the curving viaduct, which gained extra fame when the Hogwarts Express crossed it in the Harry Potter films. Don\u2019t miss climbing up the monument to the Jacobite rising (\u00a34 entry) on the shore of Loch Shiel, near the National Trust Scotland cafe (open all year). Two people get in for the price of one when you arrive by train.\n\nCarnforth, Silverdale and Lancaster, Lancashire\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lancaster Castle. Photograph: Alamy\n\n\u201cIt all started on an ordinary day in the most ordinary place in the world,\u201d begins Laura\u2019s unspoken confession to her husband in Brief Encounter (1945). No\u00ebl Coward wrote the screenplay and director David Lean chose Carnforth station, 10 minutes north of Lancaster by train, to represent Milford Junction, where a chance meeting leads to love. In the station\u2019s heritage centre, you can watch the film on a loop in retro cinema seats, or have tea and scones in the light-filled vintage refreshment room.\n\nHead up the line one more stop, past glimpses of Morecambe Bay and Warton Crag, to explore Leighton Moss RSPB Reserve. It\u2019s a five-minute stroll from Silverdale station, there\u2019s a 50% discount for car-free visitors, and plenty of winter birds among the golden reedbeds and starling murmurations overhead at sunset. Hold hands in one of seven hides (you can even get married here) and watch teal and tufted ducks dive into the lakes or marsh harriers circling above, \u00a34 with discount.\n\nStay Silverdale Hotel (doubles from \u00a370 B&B) is a cosy and friendly pub with rooms in the nearby village, with bay views. Hourly bus no 51 runs almost to the door from Leighton Moss or Carnforth.\n\nNext day There\u2019s an unbeatable choice of local walks: saunter along a stretch of cave-pitted coast or into nearby Eaves Wood, where violets and primroses may decorate the moss. Rainy day? Get the train to Lancaster: the castle, Priory church and riverside Maritime Museum (\u00a33) are all within 10 minutes\u2019 walk of the railway station.\n\n\n\nLiverpool and Wirral\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ferry on the Mersey passing Liverpool waterfront. Photograph: Alamy\n\nFerry \u2019cross the Mersey from Liverpool to Birkenhead\u2019s Woodside and elegant Hamilton Square; one of the ferries has designs by Peter Blake, co-creator of the Sgt Pepper\u2019s album cover. Saveaway tickets offer unlimited off-peak bus and train travel plus direct ferry crossings (\u00a35.55). Hop on a train to explore the garden village of Port Sunlight, founded in 1888 by William Lever for the workers in his soap factory. In the Dell, a few steps from Port Sunlight station and the ginghamtastic Tudor Rose tearoom, snowdrops and camellias flower around the sandstone bridge. It\u2019s less than 10 minutes\u2019 stroll to the Lady Lever Gallery (free), founded by Lever in memory of his wife Elizabeth. The main hall is packed with pre-Raphaelite damsels and gardens and, under one cupola, stands a 2\u00bd metre-high marble statue of Antinous, Emperor Hadrian\u2019s handsome young lover. In the half-timbered cafe downstairs, you can tuck into Scouse (meat and veg stew topped with pickled red cabbage, \u00a37.95).\n\nStay The Titanic Hotel (doubles from \u00a377, room only, \u00a3150 inc breakfast and three-course dinner, offer until 27 February), in Liverpool\u2019s Stanley Dock, is a 19th-century warehouse with cool, contemporary decor. It is well worth the half-hour walk from the city centre.\n\nNext day Hire bikes from the citybike stand outside the hotel (from \u00a33/day) for a dockside ride to the cultural fix of your choice: constructivist heads at Tate Liverpool, delicate Japanese drawings at the World Museum (\u00a36) or the full tourist dive into the Beatles Story (\u00a317), from the early energy of Love Me Do to John Lennon\u2019s Imagine \u2013 the loos are submarine-themed. Committed Fab Four fans could ride bus 76, from the bus station over the road, past Penny Lane, to Lennon\u2019s childhood home on Menlove Avenue. Strawberry Field, with a new visitor centre, free garden and cafe, is close by (\u00a312.95) and St Peter\u2019s church, where Lennon first met McCartney and the real Eleanor Rigby is buried, is four stops further.\n\nCardiff\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Banqueting Hall, Castell Coch. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nCheck out Monet\u2019s misty sunrises and Cezanne\u2019s oranges in the National Museum (free), 20 minutes\u2019 walk from Cardiff Central railway station, past the castle. Then catch the boat (\u00a35 one way) from neighbouring Bute Park to Cardiff Bay and choose a lunch spot by the water. In the afternoon, hire bikes at the bay and cycle to fairytale Castell Coch along the riverside Taff Trail, spotting herons and kingfishers before you even leave the city (Pedal Power, from \u00a316 for three hours; or catch bus 26 to Tongwynlais). With neo-gothic towers and turrets and wonderfully OTT interiors, Castell Coch is open most days (\u00a37.30).\n\nStay River House (doubles with shared bathrooms from \u00a344 B&B) is close to the train and bus stations with a farmer\u2019s market outside on Sundays. There\u2019s organic coffee and Welsh cakes for breakfast.\n\nNext day Catch the hourly bus no 32A from Westgate to the huge, free open-air St Fagans National Museum of History to explore reconstructed bronze-age huts, deep in the forest, a medieval dovecote, or graceful, terraced castle gardens with fountains, mulberry trees and vinery.\n\nAvebury and Bath\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Silbury Hill, Wiltshire. Photograph: Martin Gray/Getty Images\n\nLess crowded than Stonehenge, Avebury\u2019s prehistoric banks and sacred avenues are full of numinous wonder: ancient long barrows, tumuli under clumps of beeches and the largest megalithic stone circle in the world. And it\u2019s free to visit. Ride bus 49 from Swindon to Avebury to stroll among the stones; there\u2019s downland scenery and a glimpse of the Hackpen White Horse from the window during the half-hour journey (\u00a35.10 return). Nearby, the mysterious, 4,000-year-old Silbury Hill, similar in size to many Egyptian pyramids, towers above the little River Kennet. Snuggle up, as the sun sets, in the thatched Red Lion next to the bus stop.\n\nStay Swindon\u2019s Marriot Hotel (doubles from \u00a385, room only). Yes, it sounds screamingly unromantic but with a pool, sauna and cheerful bar, it\u2019s far more enjoyable than you might guess from outside \u2013 and close to several bus routes including the no 49 from Avebury.\n\nNext day Get the train to Bath (\u00a312.30 for a day return with GWR) for a day of Georgian gorgeousness. Follow Jane Austen\u2019s footsteps over Pulteney Bridge, through the elegant streets and gardens to see portraits by Gainsborough or the new Grayson Perry exhibition at the Holburne Museum (\u00a312.50). On weekdays, show your train tickets to get four hours for the price of two in the mineral-rich waters of the Thermae spa (\u00a336). Its eucalyptus-scented steam rooms and giant, curving jacuzzi are a 10-minute walk from the railway station. There\u2019s an outdoor, rooftop pool for after-dark swims as the floodlit turrets of Bath Abbey and neo-gothic spire of St John\u2019s loom out of the geothermal mists.\n\nWindermere, Cumbria\n\nEngland\u2019s largest lake has been attracting crowds of tourists since the Windermere and Kendal branch line arrived in 1847 but it\u2019s relatively peaceful in early spring. Catch the train from the main line at Oxenholme (15-minute ride), hire bikes at the station (from \u00a323 a day; electric bikes from \u00a337) and plan a route that takes in Blackwell Arts and Crafts house (\u00a39). Created in 1898 for a Victorian brewing tycoon, the mock-medieval hall is all stained-glass panels and peacock friezes while the light-flooded white drawing room has an iridescent turquoise-tiled fireplace and mesmerising views.\n\nStay Adults-only Applegarth Villa (doubles from \u00a3140 B&B), with its candlelit lounge, rain showers and dimmable lights, is just five minutes\u2019 walk from the station. The restaurant serves dishes like guinea fowl with black cherry and damson gin sorbet or (fabulous) gluten-free sticky toffee (\u00a329.95 for two courses). The new suites in the stable block are ideal for splashing out: they come with glowing, bubbling hot tubs on a private sunset-facing patio.\n\nNext Day Head to Bowness Pier (10 minutes on the no 599 bus) and cruise round the lake (from \u00a39 for 45-minute Islands Cruise), stopping off for lunch in the glass-walled cafe of the new Windermere Jetty museum (online prices \u00a37.50/\u00a34), overlooking the wide island-dotted water and the distant fells.\n\nBrighton, East Sussex\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest West Pier. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA\n\nThe sea glimmers blue to your left, the Weald stretches out on your right: a six-mile stretch of the blustery South Downs Way from Ditchling Beacon will clear out the cobwebs. The weekend-only double decker bus 79 heads hourly all-year-round from Brighton into the hills; sit upstairs for the best views. A \u00a35 Breeze Return lets walkers follow the acorn-marked national trail west to Devil\u2019s Dyke and catch bus 78 back from there (pub nearby). On the way, you pass the Jack and Jill windmills and the Wildflour Cafe (open from March, 10% off with your bus ticket) at Saddlescombe Farm. More car-free walking ideas along the South Downs in this leaflet.\n\nStay Jury\u2019s Inn Brighton Waterfront in the old Thistle hotel (doubles from \u00a380 room only), compensates for its monstrous architecture with sea views and a pool. Reopened in 2017 after a \u00a35m refurbishment, it backs onto Brighton\u2019s characterful Lanes, narrow shopping streets lined with cafes, and faces the bronze-pebbled beach. It\u2019s a 15-minute downhill stroll from the railway station, mostly along colourful pedestrianised streets.\n\nNext day Stroll by the sea, past the atmospheric skeleton of the old West Pier, and check out the stylish Brighton Museum (\u00a36), in the Pavilion garden, five minutes\u2019 walk from the seafront. There are decorative pieces such as Dali\u2019s Mae West Lips Sofa, paintings by Turner and Constable, and an exhibition of queer fashion until March.\n\nSheringham and Cley next the Sea, Norfolk\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cley next the Sea\u2019s reedbeds and windmill in winter. Photograph: Rod Edwards/Alamy\n\nTake the train to seaside Sheringham and switch to steam on the North Norfolk Railway (\u00a38.50 one way) for a sooty dose of nostalgia with wide views of wooded Sheringham Park and out to the shining sea. Follow the mile-long path from Weybourne station to the village, with its ruined priory, and ride the CH1 Coasthopper bus to Cley. Explore the cobbled lanes and reed-fringed paths, winding between misty sands and marshes.\n\nStay Cley Windmill (doubles from \u00a3159 B&B), whose brick tower and white sails are visible for miles across the level landscape, close to the Coasthopper bus stop. Above the circular sitting room a viewing platform overlooks the red-roofed, village and reedy Glaven valley. A ladder, at the top, leads up to the popular four-poster Wheel Room.\n\nNext day Pick up a picnic from nearby Cley Smokehouse and the local deli (smoked mackerel and lavender bread, perhaps) and catch the Coasthopper to Morston, 10 minutes further along the coast (bus day ticket \u00a310). Book ahead with Beans Boats (\u00a313/\u00a37) to cruise from the quay. Watch the harbour seals, whose round faces look as if they\u2019re smiling, and the darker, dog-faced grey seals with their more melancholic air.\n\n\u2022 Some travel provided by GWR (advance tickets from Paddington to Swindon from \u00a312.50 each way and to Cardiff from \u00a319.50) and Southern (direct Thameslink trains from London Blackfriars, St Pancras, Bedford and Cambridge, Southern trains from London Victoria to Brighton, advance tickets from \u00a35 each way).

But some things are already clear.\n\nThe first is that Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is on life support. Not so long ago, this was Biden\u2019s contest to lose. After two crushing defeats, there\u2019s no doubt about the prognosis: the former vice-president is fading fast.\n\nBloomberg and Trump are two sides of the same sinister coin | Derecka Purnell Read more\n\nBack in 2008 and 2016, Hillary Clinton ran two versions of the argument that voters wanted a mix of experience and change: of looking back and looking forward.

Democratic voters want more change, not less change. Biden likes to say that we should compare him to the alternative, not the almighty. Sadly the voters have made the comparison and found him wanting against both.\n\n\u201cWhen I die, I want to be reborn in Charleston,\u201d Biden said on Tuesday, having quit New Hampshire for South Carolina well before his defeat was final. Rebirth is a wonderful concept but probably not the best image to invoke when your campaign is flatlining.\n\nNew Hampshire buried not one but three campaigns besides Biden\u2019s. Elizabeth Warren had built a brilliant campaign around her many policy proposals until she ran into the brick wall of trying to make sense of Bernie Sanders\u2019 signature idea: Medicare for All.\n\nWho knew it would be so hard to make the math work to avoid taxing everybody while also massively expanding government healthcare?

The same goes for Pete Buttigieg, the small-town mayor who secured a fine second place in New Hampshire and a debatable first place in Iowa.\n\nWhich leaves us with one candidate with a national following, and another candidate with the ability to buy a national following.\n\nBernie Sanders won New Hampshire with a surprisingly narrow margin of victory, and is now the undoubted frontrunner in this contest. But his campaign staff \u2013 if not his fervent fans \u2013 should be deeply troubled by some of the underlying data.\n\nFar from driving out high turnout, Sanders has not attracted waves of new, younger voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. According to the CNN exit poll, just 12% of New Hampshire voters were first-timers, and just 11% were under 30 years old. All this in a state he won by 22 points four years ago, a stone\u2019s throw from his home base of Vermont.\n\nDemocrats may be concerned about the apparent weakness of every frontrunner that has passed into pole position. But the underlying numbers suggest something very different. According to the CNN exit poll, six in 10 Democrats want above all a candidate who can beat Trump.\n\nWhy is it so hard to settle on who that might be? Well the polls suggest there are several candidates who would do just that. The most recent Quinnipiac poll this week showed every single prominent Democrat with a commanding lead over the commander-in-chief, from Bloomberg (nine points) and Sanders (eight points) to Klobuchar (six points) and Buttigieg (four points). Even the mayor of the great metropolis of South Bend, Indiana, beats Donald Trump.\n\nOf course, none of those candidates have yet suffered the full onslaught of the billion-dollar disinformation campaign that Trump is yet to unleash. Except for Joe Biden, of course. And he still beats Trump by 50 to 43 points.\n\nWith so much opportunity, and frankly so much fear, Democrats are shopping around for their best bet to beat the biggest bozo. They don\u2019t seem to care about the ideology or character of their candidate as long as she or he isn\u2019t a white nationalist with the attention span of an amoeba.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Minnesota senator started her non-victory speech by saying, \u201cHello America.

The prime minister said in parliament that there would be more services, including at evenings and weekends, and simpler, cheaper and more convenient fares, as well as more bus lanes and zero-carbon buses. But while \u00a35bn could build quite a lot of bus lanes, it will not have much impact on fares and services unless it is accompanied by countrywide regulation of local public transport.\n\nIn 1985, control over Britain\u2019s buses passed from local authorities to private companies. Deregulation meant that instead of local authorities planning the bus network, private bus operators could decide where and when to run buses, based on which routes were most profitable. It was supposed to lead to an improvement in services, and an increase in the number of people travelling by bus. The Conservative government at the time said that \u201cwithout the dead hand of restrictive regulation, fares could be reduced on many bus routes and the operator would still make a profit. New and better services would be provided. More people would travel.\u201d\n\nBut deregulation had the opposite effect: fares rose, services worsened and bus use fell. The decline was most catastrophic in the places that previously had the highest levels of bus travel. According to census data for 1981 and 2001, 41% of workers in Sheffield travelled by bus at the beginning of the 1980s, but two decades later that figure had halved to 19%.\n\nAusterity cuts from 2010 meant that councils had to make impossible choices between funding for social care and funding for transport\n\nWith bus operators focusing on the most profitable routes, the lack of services elsewhere was addressed in part by local authorities paying for extra \u201csocially necessary\u201d journeys. That worked to a degree, though it meant that bus services increasingly came to be seen as a basic safety net rather than an essential public service.\n\nAusterity cuts from 2010 meant that councils had to make impossible choices between funding for social care and funding for transport. Not surprisingly, it was budgets for buses that were cut. The result was a further slashing of services, especially in rural areas.\n\nIronically, it was the Conservative chancellor George Osborne who finally recognised that deregulation had been a failure. Three years ago the government legislated to allow large local authorities with elected mayors to regulate their bus services again. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, seems likely to be the first mayor to do that, though the process that his transport authority has to go through to get the regulatory powers has been complicated and drawn out. Local authorities outside the big conurbations were not given this power, however.\n\nOver on the continent, Switzerland embarked on a very different journey. Just two years after buses were deregulated in the UK, the canton of Zurich passed a law specifying the public transport services citizens could expect: an hourly service for settlements of 300 people; a half-hourly service for people living on main corridors; and a service at least every 15 minutes for residents of dense urban areas. All services were to run from 6am to midnight, seven days a week.\n\nThe difference in the destinations reached by the respective countries is stark: the average citizen of Zurich canton makes 450 public transport trips a year, compared with about 100 trips a year in equivalent areas in England. One part of the UK did not suffer bus deregulation in the 1980s \u2013 in London, services stayed under public control. While bus trips outside London halved over the following 30 years, use in the capital doubled. Londoners now make as many local bus, Underground and local train trips each year as the citizens of Zurich canton.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The average citizen of Zurich canton makes 450 public transport trips a year, compared with about 100 trips a year in equivalent areas in England.\u2019 A rural bus service at Gargrave, North Yorkshire. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/Guardian\n\nAs a result of deregulation, the public sector can only provide capital for bus lanes, but it can\u2019t specify what services will run on them, or how often, or at what fares. And worst of all, it can\u2019t design a complete network. So right now, Boris Johnson\u2019s billions will have a limited impact. The only way to improve bus travel in the UK is to reverse deregulation and provide local authorities with Swiss-style powers to regulate and coordinate their bus services, coupled with ongoing funding for a comprehensive offering that enables convenient travel any time of day, any day of the week, between any two places bigger than a small village. And so far, there are no hints of that happening.\n\nA road to the north, a bridge across the sea \u2013 nice symbols, but they won\u2019t unite the UK | Gaby Hinsliff Read more\n\nAside from the important function of providing transport from A to B, buses now have an increasingly important role to play in tackling the climate emergency. To stand any chance of meeting the Paris climate agreement targets, we will have to cut the amount of driving we do. That implies some restraint on car use, which will only command public consent if it happens in parallel with recognition that people have a right to decent, affordable alternative ways of travelling. Action on the climate emergency doesn\u2019t just require a few more electric buses, it requires Swiss-style public transport so that buses become not just a better form of transport, but our main form of transport.\n\nSo one cheer for Johnson recognising that buses are important and that they deserve at least \u00a35bn. But I\u2019ll only be giving three cheers if he follows up with an announcement of Swiss-style powers to regulate and coordinate services.

Rules on farmers cutting hedgerows and field margins that have protected the habitats of a variety of at-risk species are being lost amid the biggest shake-up of nature regulations in four decades.\n\nFor three years, ministers have been proclaiming that leaving the EU would allow Britain to strengthen its environmental protections, and that all the benefits of membership would be faithfully carried over. Now we can see the worth of those promises, in a trio of bills set before parliament. The environment bill, agriculture bill and fisheries bill replace the EU\u2019s comprehensive framework directives, common agricultural policy and common fisheries policy.\n\nAll three bills contain major flaws that undermine the government\u2019s claims. They leave gaps, fail on enforcement and oversight, open loopholes for future ministers to quietly backslide from existing standards, and turn what is currently a coherent system of long-term, stable regulation into a patchwork of competing and sometimes contradictory proposals.\n\nBoris Johnson must examine the science of cheap food imports Read more\n\nTake the environment bill. It sets out four priority areas, some of them critical for human health: air quality, waste and resource efficiency, water and nature. Air pollution contributes to 40,000 deaths a year, and the new bill sets out a framework for standards on key pollutants. Yet although this bill could be law within a few months, the new standards on air \u2013 along with those on the other three priority areas \u2013 will not be set until October 2022.\n\nThe government says the delay is to give time for expert input. Parents struggling to get their breathless children to A&E every time there is a pollution spike might take the view that the World Health Organization, the EU and academic studies around the world have already answered the questions over what constitutes breathable air. Why do they have to wait more than two years without legal safeguards before even being allowed to know what the new limits will be?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Under the EU\u2019s air quality directive, ministers were obliged not just to adhere to targets for air pollutants but to publish plans showing how the targets would be met.\u2019 Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nThe watering down does not stop there. Under the EU\u2019s air quality directive, ministers were obliged not just to adhere to targets for air pollutants but to publish plans showing how the targets would be met. That was where campaigners scored their most notable victories, when they took the government to court over Britain\u2019s filthy air and judges ruled the plans were not valid. The new environment bill dispenses with the need for detailed plans that can be weighed up by experts and used to hold government to account. Instead, ministers will be required only to set out the steps they intend to take, without accountability as to whether those measures are sufficient.\n\nNew powers have also been quietly inserted for the government to derogate from high standards at will. Clause 81 of the environment bill gives the secretary of state powers to weaken targets for the chemical status of our water, either by relaxing the targets or changing the rules by which they are measured.\n\nTo reassure the public \u2013 who will no longer be able to take the government to the European courts over any failures \u2013 there is to be a watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection. Will it have the same powers as the European courts? No. Will its judgments be binding? Not necessarily. Who will make up its board? Ministers will decide.\n\nThe agriculture bill and the fisheries bill, while containing some admirable aims, are also worrying. The EU\u2019s common agricultural policy was often disastrous for wildlife and nature, and the government was rightly cheered when it proposed paying farmers for providing public goods \u2013 clean water, good soil, flood protection. But the new system of environmental land management contracts \u2013 to be phased in over seven years \u2013 will be voluntary and the measures farmers will be required to take will be decided at the level of individual farms. This leaves gaps.\n\nCurrently, there are specific protections for species and habitats that apply across the UK. Under environmental land management contracts, many of those protections \u2013 like the ones for nesting birds and hedgehogs \u2013 will become voluntary. Farmers could pick and choose what protections they sign up to, and those who do not want the public money could opt out altogether. And who will monitor the farmers who do? With ministers wanting to cut the number of farm inspections, enforcement looks hazy too.\n\nJettisoning the EU\u2019s common fisheries policy also offered ministers a chance to stop rampant overfishing. They have not taken it. The bill retains a broad aim to restore stocks to \u201cmaximum sustainable yield\u201d \u2013 the level, worked out by scientists, at which fishing does not harm the ability of the fish population to reproduce. But the fishing quotas each year are still to be set by ministers, with the power to depart from that scientific advice, and to choose which stocks will be fished sustainably and which will not.\n\nUnless the government accepts amendments to these vital bills in the coming weeks and months, the UK will be quietly swapping an agreed set of outcomes and stringent environmental protections for a set of vague promises, voluntary measures, and deliberately loose and leaky legislation. Hedgehogs and voles will not be the only losers.\n\n\u2022 Fiona Harvey is an award-winning environment journalist for the Guardian", "author": ["Fiona Harvey"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/nationalism-scottish-border-tory-boris-johnson-nicola-sturgeon", "published": "2020-02-12T06:00:25", "title": "Nationalism is winning - on both sides of the Scottish border | Rafael Behr", "text": "More people in England have already forgotten the name of the Scottish finance minister who resigned last week than ever knew it before the scandal broke. Derek Mackay was hardly a celebrity in Scotland, but his disgrace made news there for more than a few hours. Mackay had compulsively messaged a 16-year-old boy on social media, calling him \u201ccute\u201d and offering him trips out. The behaviour was \u201cfoolish\u201d, he said. Opponents called it predatory.\n\nQuestions followed about the Scottish National party\u2019s handling of the matter and how its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, should patch the hole in her cabinet, but England had tuned out by then. Scandal is union-wide; aftermath is devolved. This isn\u2019t new. People have limited bandwidth for politics, and the SNP doesn\u2019t govern England. Holyrood is a niche interest even for Westminster nerds. But the longer this segregation of political cultures goes on, the harder it gets to argue for a United Kingdom.\n\nSturgeon is counting on Brexit to drive divergence to the point where independence feels irresistible. Two-thirds of Scots wanted to stay in the EU, and their ejection from it on Boris Johnson\u2019s terms reinforces old resentment of rule by remote English Tories. Sturgeon hopes fresh anger will keep her party buoyant through next year\u2019s Scottish parliament elections despite a heavy freight of incumbency. The SNP has been running Scotland for nearly 13 years \u2013 time enough to write a catalogue of troubles, of which the Mackay saga is just an appendix. Later this year Alex Salmond, Sturgeon\u2019s predecessor, goes on trial over allegations of sexual assault and attempted rape.\n\nSo far the SNP has relied on the inadequacy of the opposition to weather storms, and there is no sign of that shelter being withdrawn. If you had forgotten his name, Richard Leonard is Labour\u2019s Scottish leader but not the answer to any other questions. His party has fluffed the issue of a second independence referendum, and not just because Jeremy Corbyn was eyeing deals with the SNP to build a Commons majority. The radical English left already had a soft spot for Scottish nationalism. Corbyn likes causes that parade as liberation struggles, and avoids positions that involve defence of the British state in its established form. A similar impulse persuades Scottish Greens to support independence.\n\nIt\u2019s crisis after crisis for the SNP, but it will still retain power in 2021 | Ruth Wishart Read more\n\nNon-aligned unionists miss Ruth Davidson\u2019s voice in the debate. The former Tory leader in Edinburgh was an adept reader of Scottish politics, and proved it by quitting rather than waste her skills defending Johnson.\n\nThe SNP benefits also from a shift in attitudes since Brexit. Polls show discernible movement towards independence, driven by remainers who voted no in 2014. There is demographic momentum too. Younger voters like independence. But Sturgeon\u2019s strongest card is the total capture of Westminster by Tories, with the prime minister\u2019s anglocentric swagger providing bonus repulsion of Scottish voters.\n\nJohnson\u2019s administration also makes it hard for non-Tories in England to plead the unionist cause. In theory, ancient bonds are precious under any government, and as worthy of defence outside the EU as in it. Tories can be ousted, while cutting the UK\u2019s constitutional cord is forever. Anti-Brexit arguments should also translate into rebuttal of the case for Scottish independence. In both scenarios it is unwise, impractical and expensive to repaint borders that progress had erased. But fewer remainers have the heart to push that line when the union whose virtues they must extol has Boris, Brexiteer Supreme, as its champion.\n\nPlay Video 1:24 Nicola Sturgeon: independence best for Scotland post-Brexit - video\n\nFacing at least five years of Tory government, many English voters might envy the Scots their referendum escape raft and their dreams of sailing it back to Europe. Sturgeon was in Brussels on Monday advertising her readiness for that journey. Even if it looks like a long shot, plenty of demoralised remainers will root for her if the alternative is cultural capitulation to Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage.\n\nWhile moderate unionist voices are muted, the noisiest opponents of Scottish separation are tin-eared Tories who can\u2019t praise the heritage of Great Britain without sounding as if they mostly mean England. Even if Johnson aims for an emollient tone he will be quickly baited into confrontation with the SNP over demands for a referendum. The Tory leader has only two settings: frivolous and contemptuous. He visibly struggles not to despise those whom he cannot entertain.\n\nIncumbency will also weigh on the Tories. Brexit promises will be pulped in the negotiating mill, and foreigners will be blamed. Johnson will sound increasingly like an English nationalist. The prime minister thinks his permissive social attitudes and free-trader rhetoric make him a liberal. It is true, up to a point. Yet that point is reached whenever expediency requires a tilt into chauvinism and xenophobia. Johnson embodies a common delusion that the English are inherently resistant to nationalism, seen as a vulgar condition afflicting less pragmatic nations.\n\nScotland\u2019s independence campaigners have a similar trick, insisting theirs is the good kind of nationalism \u2013 \u201ccivic\u201d, \u201cprogressive\u201d \u2013 not like the mean, atavistic strain that sows conflict and division. They too have a point. Sturgeon is no despot, and the SNP has egalitarian intent. But the test is not the ambition with which nationalism starts, it is the turn taken when utopia is not reached. The beginning is always democracy, freedom and romance. The end is always disappointment and a hunt for traitors. Nationalists never own their mistakes because there is always some remnant of the old regime or a foreign neighbour to scapegoat.\n\nWhether the bad guys are in Brussels or Westminster, the model has the same flaw. The idea that the collective destiny of a nation can be truly expressed only by the victory of one party or one leader is a well-trodden historical dead end. Nationalism rejects the moral validity of rival programmes. It demotes tolerance and, when short of fuel, taps the rage of fanatics. It is poisonous to liberal democracy, although democratic principle demands it be given space on a ballot paper. Once there, it stands out in bold colours against politicians who deal in grey shades of complexity.\n\nThose of us who wanted to stay in the EU, and also want to keep the union of England and Scotland, lack compelling stories to rival the myths that drive separatism. It is a grimly familiar sensation \u2013 watching from the sidelines, muttering boring old facts while the fate of our country is settled by better storytellers. History is meant to be our vaccine against nationalism, but it doesn\u2019t work when we let nationalists rewrite the past in order to spell out the future in their own words.\n\n\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist", "author": ["Rafael Behr"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/protection-law-politicians-judges-courts", "published": "2020-02-12T09:00:28", "title": "This government has plans that would destroy the protection of the law | Charles Falconer", "text": "On Sunday, the lord chancellor, Robert Buckland, said he would resist attempts to politicise and weaken the judiciary. He said he would uphold his oath as lord chancellor to protect judges\u2019 independence. He\u2019s taking on his own government and we should support him.\n\nThe Tory manifesto included a pledge to restrict the courts\u2019 powers to take on the government. It characterised some recent judicial review findings against the government as abusive \u2013 the ruling against prorogation and the Gina Miller case are presumably what they had in mind. This government is determined to prevent the courts from being a fetter on what it wants to do.\n\nIt has two muzzles in mind. First, giving politicians greater influence over the appointment of senior judges, and second, taking some big government decisions that affect politics out of judicial review. No 10 briefed, the night before the Queen\u2019s speech in December, either ignorantly or deceitfully, of decreasing the power of the supreme court, and increasing the power of the lord chancellor. It claims to fear the UK court becoming like the US supreme court which decides big political issues such as abortion or desegregation.\n\nLady Hale\u2019s story is a lesson in self-belief. We need more like her in positions of power | Gaby Hinsliff Read more\n\nIn the US there is a written constitution which sets limits on what Congress can do. The US supreme court determines what those limits are. The constitution, for example, determines whether everyone has a right to choose whether to have an abortion. In the UK, where there is no written constitution, parliament is sovereign. It decides whether abortion should be permitted. Once parliament has decided an issue like that the courts cannot interfere. And they don\u2019t.\n\nProf Richard Ekins, the head of the judicial power project at the government\u2019s favourite thinktank, Policy Exchange, has suggested increasing the lord chancellor\u2019s power to interfere with senior judicial appointments, to ensure that \u201cjudicial activists\u201d don\u2019t get appointed to senior positions. He suggests the lord chancellor should more often use his existing, very limited, powers to reject judges proposed by the independent judicial appointments commission and should be given new power to choose all senior judicial appointments from a shortlist of three.\n\nThis is wrong-headed. The more politicians are involved in judicial appointments, the more political judges will become. Not in the sense that they will start to decide issues like abortion, but that they will start to decide cases in a way that will get them promoted by politicians. At the heart of Ekins\u2019s independence-reducing idea is the view that some \u2013 not all \u2013 judges do not respect the supremacy of parliament and, for example, construe statutes in ways that do not give effect to the intention of parliament, or decide judicial review cases in a way that seeks to frustrate the will of parliament. Giving the politicians more say in weeding out those judges who are too \u201cactivist\u201d will, he believes, ensure a cadre of senior judges who respect the line between the courts and politics. As he must know, it will lead to judges who defer to the executive being promoted more.\n\nThe other prong of the No 10 plan to weaken the supreme court is to declare, by statute, that cases such as the prorogation one last year, which involve the exercise of the royal prerogative, are beyond the reach of the courts \u2013 they are non-justiciable. This would have prevented the supreme court finding that the prorogation of parliament was unlawful.\n\nStrengthening the role of the lord chancellor is No 10\u2019s sweetener for the reduction of the power and independence of the supreme court. The only measure it has mentioned so far is specifying that the lord chancellor should be a lawyer. Yes, that would help to avoid Titanic disasters such as Chris Grayling or Liz Truss. But you can always find an amenable lawyer. Among the casualties of Harold Macmillan\u2019s night of the long knives cabinet reshuffle was Lord Kilmuir, the lord chancellor. He complained he had received less notice than would his cook. Macmillan replied that cooks were a lot harder to come by than lord chancellors.\n\nThe purpose of the judicial appointments process must above all be to ensure independence of the judges from the executive. If their promotion to the supreme court depends on pleasing the politicians their independence is crucially compromised. The ability of the lord chancellor to remonstrate with the prime minister is no substitute for the courts fearlessly prohibiting unlawful acts, and unscrambling their consequences.\n\nThe effect of declaring by statute that something is non-justiciable is to declare that it is outside the realm of the law. The courts would be powerless to prevent it \u2013 because it would be for the politicians to resolve. And the lord chancellor, the voice of the law in cabinet, would, rightly, be told that since the issue is outside the realm of the law he or she is the last person with any authority on the issue.\n\nThe executive can arrest, imprison, remove children, confiscate property, remove union rights, close down parliament indefinitely, close businesses, close publications, declare war, sell arms and break humanitarian law, deport. It is the courts, not the lord chancellor, that prevent the abusive use of these powers. The lord chancellor can protest internally within government or even publicly. And that is of some value as a restraint on a government embarking on flagrantly unlawful conduct, for example, by deliberately breaking an act of parliament such as the Benn Act. But ultimately the courts alone can prohibit unlawful state actions. They are proudly and defiantly independent of the government. They uphold the rights of the citizen against the executive. And do so even in cases where it upsets the government\u2019s political plans.\n\nThe protection of the law will be destroyed if judicial promotion is dependent on not upsetting the government, and if courts cannot rule on cases that might embarrass the state. The lord chancellor needs all our support to stop this.\n\n\u2022 Lord Falconer was lord chancellor in Tony Blair\u2019s government", "author": ["Charles Falconer"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/12/trump-america-first-policy-offers-beijing-and-brussels-a-chance-to-lead", "published": "2020-02-12T06:00:25", "title": "Trump's 'America first' policy offers Beijing and Brussels a chance to lead | Barry Eichengreen", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies are widely regarded as an abdication of global leadership, sounding the death knell of the post-second world war multilateral order that the US shaped and sustained.\n\nThere is much truth to this view. At the same time, this troubling turn represents a reversion to longstanding US values. Acknowledging that the second half of the 20th century was an anomaly, rather than the norm, raises troubling questions about the nature of US leadership and the fate of multilateralism after Trump.\n\nAs a resource-rich continental economy separated from Europe and Asia by vast Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the US has always been tempted by isolationism. Thomas Jefferson famously spoke of no entangling alliances. The Monroe doctrine, from 1823, was not just an assertion of US dominance in the western hemisphere but also an effort to keep the US out of European wars.\n\nIn the 20th century, the US entered the world wars several years late, long after the stakes were clear, and only after being directly provoked by German U-boat attacks and the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor.\n\nDonald Trump is a good president \u2026 but only for the top 1% Read more\n\nMoreover, the US long sought to advance its interests abroad unilaterally rather than through multilateral engagement. The Monroe doctrine is a case in point. The US\u2019s refusal after the first world war to join the League of Nations is another.\n\nEqually important, domestic business has long held inordinate sway over US economic and foreign policies. This historical pattern reflects the fact that it was the first country of continental scope to industrialise. Its immense internal market supported the efforts of US entrepreneurs to pioneer the large multidivisional corporation in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nThis was the age of the robber barons, who held sway over not just the US economy but also its politics. For example, the \u201cbig four\u201d California railway tycoons (Leland Stanford, Collis Huntington, Mark Hopkins, and Charles Crocker) controlled not just freight rates but also the state legislature. Viewed from this perspective, the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to cater to domestic corporations\u2019 every regulatory whim is firmly in step with US history.\n\nAmericans\u2019 deep, abiding and historically rooted distrust of government also reinforces isolationism. The view that government only creates problems is not just a product of Fox News. The US\u2019s founders were profoundly suspicious of overweening government, from which they suffered under British colonialism.\n\nAfter independence from Britain, the fact and then the legacy of slavery created deep-seated opposition to federal interference with local social arrangements and states\u2019 rights. Rallies of gun-rights advocates at state capitols and the occupation of federal land by western ranchers are peculiarly American aberrations, but they are also modern-day manifestations of the long-held view that government cannot be trusted and that the best government is one that governs least. Trump and his policies stand squarely in this tradition.\n\nThe existential threat of the second world war was enough to shock the US out of its isolationist, anti-government tendencies, at least temporarily. Possessing the single strongest economy, along with politicians, including presidents, with personal experience of war, the postwar US was able to provide the leadership needed to construct an open, multilateral order.\n\nBut it was naive to think that this was \u201cthe end of history\u201d \u2013 that the US would continue to exercise this kind of international leadership indefinitely. In the event, growing economic insecurity, together with the rise of identity politics (reflecting the inability of the once-dominant white majority to adjust to the reality of greater socioeconomic diversity), was enough to cause the American body politic to revert to its unilateral, isolationist mindset.\n\nThe next US president \u2013 whoever she or he may be \u2013 is unlikely to be as committed to free trade, alliance building, and multilateral institutions and rules as the presidents of the second half of the 20th century. But it is still possible to imagine multilateralism without the US. Climate change illustrates the point: Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 Paris climate agreement has not weakened the commitment of other countries to its targets, nor should it.\n\nAnother example is how the European Union, China and 15 other countries reacted to Trump\u2019s efforts to paralyse the World Trade Organisation by leaving its appellate body inquorate with too few judges. In response, they set up their own ad hoc, shadow appellate body to maintain WTO standards and procedures.\n\nAs this last case demonstrates, the successor to US global leadership must be collective global leadership, with the two largest economies, the EU and China, at its fore. Unlike the US, the EU is making every effort to work with China. Given the inevitable geopolitical tensions, cooperation won\u2019t be easy. But, as the US once understood, it is the only way.\n\n\u2022 Barry Eichengreen is professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former senior policy adviser at the International Monetary Fund.

The gap between the Premiership and Championship was wide enough already before the Rugby Football Union turned it into a chasm with Wednesday\u2019s announcement that funding to the second tier would be slashed from next season. Life was already hard for players and clubs; now many fear it will be nigh on impossible to continue in their current form.\n\nChampionship clubs in shock over RFU\u2019s decision to slash funding by 50% Read more\n\nFor a taste of reality away from the glamour of the Six Nations and the Premiership, consider instead the story of the former Bedford Blues and Canada player Justin Blanchet. As recently as September, he was still vying for selection for his country\u2019s Rugby World Cup squad. The week before the team landed in Japan, playing in a warmup Test against the USA in Vancouver, he suffered his fourth concussion in 12 months. With a history of head injuries already, it proved one too many for the Montreal-born back-rower.\n\nThe 26-year-old\u2019s abrupt departure from the game went mostly unnoticed among the rugby public. Yet Blanchet\u2019s story underlines the stark realities of professional rugby, particularly that of England\u2019s second tier. Outside the Premiership, there is no safety net if things go wrong.\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling, particularly in the Championship, of whether it is all worth it,\u201d says Blanchet. \u201cI became frustrated with rugby. I was giving up so much of my body, my mind and emotion. Most Championship players are on significantly less than people may think.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Justin Blanchet, right, tackles Bristol\u2019s Jamal Ford-Robinson in a match for Bedford Blues in 2015. Photograph: Rogan Thomson/Jmp/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cPersonally, I just didn\u2019t feel I was being properly remunerated. When players are earning no more than \u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000 and start getting injuries, questions begin coming into your head.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Blanchet, who has seven Canada caps to his name and has also played at Exeter Chiefs, last year was the final straw. \u201cAs a sports person you are selfish with a narrow view of things and my goal was the World Cup. I knew the more I told the medical team about my head injuries, the less likely I would be going to the tournament.\n\nIn the Championship there is no support network. It is sad to feel that in a professional setup there is no one acting on your behalf. It feels a bit amateur\n\n\u201cBut my body was failing me. On top of my head injuries, within a year I had two broken arms that never felt like they were healing fully.\u201d\n\nIn the Championship, even before the current financial model is ripped up, getting injured can spell disaster financially. Blanchet considers himself one of the lucky ones because Bedford ensure their players are properly covered in terms of medical insurance. It is not the case everywhere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not great if I\u2019m honest. You hear of horror stories from other clubs of those not covered, something that is unfathomable. In the Championship, there is no support network. It is sad to feel that in a professional setup there is no one acting on your behalf. In all honesty it feels a bit amateur,\u201d says Blanchet, who holds an economics degree from the University of Exeter.\n\n\u201cA few years ago, there was a story in the Guardian about the Championship being the wild west of rugby. I think that\u2019s bang on. I think the Rugby Players\u2019 Association is great but the fact they don\u2019t cover the whole of the professional environment needs to be addressed. Why is there not a group for everyone playing the game professionally?\u201d\n\nBlanchet\u2019s story is not uncommon in the Championship. The league may have helped numerous players along the road to international recognition but that does not paint the full picture. The English second tier is not a lush pasture for professional players to graze on, particularly if bad luck strikes.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\n\u201cInjuries don\u2019t just cost you appearances, they cost you a contract, a way of literally paying the bills,\u201d says Blanchet. \u201cSquads and budgets are small and clubs don\u2019t have the resources to keep someone who is injury prone. I\u2019ve seen it so many times. There is that added pressure of feeling you need to get back on the field even if you aren\u2019t 100%. I\u2019m sure many players will testify to the same feelings I had. Physically and financially I felt I was stagnating with it all.\u201d\n\nAs the Premiership salary cap debate rages on, it is also worth remembering that plenty of players are being paid a pittance for taking precisely the same risks as their top-tier cousins. It is a situation that will only worsen next season when the RFU cuts the annual central funding for each club from \u00a3530,000 to \u00a3280,000. Many Championship players say they frequently feel like second-class citizens.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Justin Blanchet with the USA\u2019s Will Hooley before the 2019 World Cup \u2013 a tournament Blanchet never ended up playing in. Photograph: Canterbury\n\n\u201cJust having access to work experience days would be huge, or even having an individual for players to contact if they need help on a personal matter,\u201d adds Blanchet. \u201cAt the moment there\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m lucky that I have incredible support from my family and girlfriend, but not everyone may have that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret rugby, it has given me some important life skills and has allowed me to meet some incredible people. Ultimately, though, the transition when you finish is incredibly challenging. I just stress to all players to look after yourself and think about life outside of rugby.\u201d\n\nFortunately for Saracens, their players will continue to be looked after by the RPA as part of the parachute payments that go to the team relegated to the Championship.

Birmingham\u2019s home ground, Damson Park, the home of National League Solihull Moors, has seen two games abandoned. Prenton Park, where Liverpool Women and League One Tranmere Rovers play, is a bog and has also seen two women\u2019s games called off. To avoid further chaos Liverpool\u2019s game against Arsenal on Thursday has been moved to Chester.

Yes, clubs have committed to token games at their main stadiums; all bar Manchester United, Arsenal and Birmingham have hosted league games at their primary stadiums this term. Those gestures deserve to be applauded and celebrated. But professionalism has accelerated the change and clubs are failing to keep up with the demands that that change brings. This is not about sharing main stadiums, yet. But it is time to question what is holding clubs back from properly investing in their women\u2019s teams.\n\nCommitting to funding drainage systems or pitch heaters at the ground their teams play on should be a no-brainier. Quality surfaces protect players. These are, on the whole, extremely wealthy clubs. That women\u2019s teams at present operate at a loss should not be an issue. The trickle of resources should be flowing more freely and that the tap is not being turned is a choice.\n\nBeing kind, perhaps they have been caught off guard by the demand. But these are not the only wrongs that need righting. Short-term contracts are still the norm, low wages are standard for the majority, conditions at many clubs lag way behind the provisions afforded the men\u2019s teams. It is not hard to at the very least share resources.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manchester City training at the football academy which also houses the men\u2019s team. Photograph: Tom Flathers/Manchester City FC via Getty Images\n\nThe former Manchester City manager Nick Cushing said as much in his final sit-down before his departure for New York City FC. \u201cIt was really simple for us \u2013 all it took was that the staff didn\u2019t have a negative perception of the girls in the women\u2019s game,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I look at maybe teams not training at their facility or playing on different grounds, I just think it\u2019s crazy.

I could say they loan us their expertise \u2013 but they don\u2019t, we are all part of the same football club.\u201d\n\nIn fact it must be harder to build anything close to that expertise from scratch as a separate enterprise than to find a way to integrate a women\u2019s set-up.\n\nClubs, though, aren\u2019t the only ones to have been caught napping. The Football Association has struggled to build the infrastructure around the league. Refereeing is at breaking point. A weekend does not pass without a litany of errors. It is no fault of the referees, who are not full-time, taking home a \u00a3120 match fee. The penalty awarded to Reading for a perceived handball by Katie Zelem, who had in fact cleanly headed the ball, went viral. All to often women\u2019s football clips go mainstream for the wrong reasons. The ambition of the FA is, eventually, professional referees but there is no timescale for that. There should be. A professional league requires professional officials. It is, again, not fair to the fans, players or, for that matter, the referees.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nFrom top to bottom the FA is struggling.

Every plan since, the core of its Gameplan for Growth, has been make sure those opportunities do not go to waste again. Yet here we are. The arguments for investment have been won, big attendances have been proven, TV audiences are strong, sponsors are on board; it is time clubs and the FA threw themselves in head first, instead of easing in slowly.\n\nTalking points\n\n\u2022 The FA is discussing shifting next year\u2019s Community Shield from Wembley to sidestep a clash with the Women\u2019s European Championship finals.

He was on Lazio\u2019s books from 1992 to 1999 but was loaned out each season, and never made an appearance with the first team,\u201d writes J\u00f6rg Michner. \u201cHe eventually moved to Piacenza as part of the deal that brought Simone Inzaghi to Lazio, who has remained at the club since then and is now the manager.\u201d Sticking with Italy, Milan Skriniar is currently a rock at the back for Inter, whose rivals are \u2026 yeah, yeah, you get it.\n\nFootballers who share their names with film titles redux | The Knowledge Read more\n\nStephan Bird takes us to the East End of London. \u201cSurely the canonical answer for this is Bobby Moore, full name: Robert Frederick Chelsea Moore.\u201d If we move into international football, Mike England is a good shout. \u201cHe gained 44 caps for Wales and did play against the neighbours,\u201d pipes up Tom Aldous. \u201cAnd in Spain there is Salva Sevilla, who spent four seasons at Real Betis.\u201d He scored against Sevilla in the Europa League in 2014, too.\n\nThere\u2019s also defender Nicol\u00f2 Napoli, who played for long-distance rivals Juventus, before Juan Cervantes takes us slightly off-piste. Gerard Piqu\u00e9 shares his name with the stadium of his big foe. His full name is: Gerard Piqu\u00e9 Bernabeu.\u201d\n\nAnd to broaden things out a little, we took a look at players with places in their names back in 2016.\n\nThe biggest title-winning points margin\n\n\u201cLiverpool have a 22-point advantage \u2013 what\u2019s the biggest point margin for a title winning team?\u201d tweets Andr\u00e9s Mora.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m very late to the party in highlighting Celtic\u2019s 30-point winning margin over Aberdeen in the 2016-17 season,\u201d writes Harry Shave, who is actually the first and only reveller to turn up to this title party. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s also worth an honourable mention to Vardar Skopje\u2019s 1992-93 championship winning season. Although they only won the league by 21 points, that was in a season where only two points were awarded for a win. If that was converted to three points then Vardar would have finished 31 ahead of Sileks Kratovo.\n\n\u201cIn the 2007-08 Botswana Premier League, Centre Chief finished 23 points ahead of Gaborone United,\u201d Harry continues.

Their home ground is the Olympiastadion, which, since renovations in 2004, has a permanent capacity of 74,475 seats. They even stayed there for their stint in the 2. Bundesliga (instead of moving to the Poststadion as they did when they were relegated in the 80s).\n\n\u201cThe runner-up might be Juventus, who were forcibly relegated after the Calciopoli scandal in 2006, while the Stadio delle Alpi had a capacity of 69,000 (although they usually only filled a third of it). Juve actually used the relegation to move out of the unloved and old stadium to their smaller-capacity traditional ground Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino, while building a new stadium on the grounds of the demolished Stadio delle Alpi, which they finished in 2011.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Maracan\u00e3 had a capacity of over 130,000 when Fluminense were relegated in 1997. Photograph: Felipe Dana/AP\n\nTom Aldous can trump both of those. \u201cFluminense play at the Maracan\u00e3 which today has an official capacity of 78,838, but the highest ever gate there was 199,854 in 16 July 1950. In 1997 Fluminense were relegated to the Brazilian Serie B but worse was to come the following year when they were relegated again to Serie C. In 2000 they were promoted straight back to Serie A in a championship that is way too complicated for me to comprehend.\u201d\n\nIn 1997 the Maracan\u00e3 hosted a title decider between Cruzeiro and Villa Nova with an attendance of 132,834, but by 2000 the capacity was reduced to around 100,000. Speaking of Cruzeiro, they were relegated earlier this year, sparking a riot at their 62,000-capacity Mineir\u00e3o ground \u2013 also the scene of Brazil\u2019s 2014 World Cup humiliation.\n\nBut Michael St John-Mcalister thinks he has a winner in Scotland. \u201cQueen\u2019s Park must be in with a shout here. Hampden\u2019s record attendance is 149,547 in April 1937. Queen\u2019s Park, who have played there since 1903, were relegated in 1939 \u2013 as well as several other times \u2013 but that\u2019s the closest relegation to the stadium\u2019s record attendance, and capacity has been gradually reduced since 1945.\u201d\n\nKnowledge archive\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a rumour that Roma have offered Alessandro Crescenzi in exchange for Catania releasing coach Vincenzo Montella,\u201d wrote ZonalMarking in May 2012. \u201cA player-manager swap deal?

Faria was MLS Rookie of the Year in 2001 and led the Metros with 14 goals in all competitions in 2002. He didn\u2019t last a full season for the Fire, was sent to San Jose, helped them to the 2003 MLS Cup, and was out of soccer soon after. Bradley coached the Metros for two and a half seasons, before being fired by the clown Alexi Lalas in one of the most idiotic moves in history of MLS.\u201d\n\nCan you help?\n\n\u201cLast week (5 February 2020) I achieved my second appearance in The Knowledge (of which I\u2019m aware) with my answer regarding long-distance city namesake teammates,\u201d begins Graeme Atkinson. \u201cMy first appearance came on 8 November 2001 with an answer regarding sitcom characters and the teams they support.

While officers in normal police uniform are engaging more with supporters following the change of policy, the force still deploys officers in protective gear, with Nato helmets and batons, depending on the assessed likelihood of disorder.\n\nThe Football League is funding research this season into project \u201cEnable,\u201d which promotes a more progressive approach to policing matches and has argued that the deployment of officers equipped for riot or disorder control is often excessive and counterproductive.\n\nSouth Yorkshire police\u2019s methods are subject to more scrutiny than some other forces owing to historical scandals involving the force and the fact the deputy chief constable, Mark Roberts, is the national lead officer in the UK Football Policing Unit, an influential part of the Home Office.\n\nThe force\u2019s modern football policing was subjected to serious public criticism following problems at the derby between Wednesday and United at Hillsborough last March. Some supporters complained they were held in a crush outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles as they left the ground after the match, and that police officers had indiscriminately hit people with batons. Fans responding to a survey by the Football Supporters\u2019 Federation rated the policing as on average 1.9 out of 10, and described the policing as \u201catrocious,\u201d \u201cirresponsible,\u201d and \u201cintimidating and unapproachable\u201d.\n\nLouise Haigh, the MP for Sheffield Heeley and Labour\u2019s shadow minister for policing and crime, said of Saturday\u2019s incident: \u201cThis event has caused deep public concern and underlines a sense among fans that matchdays are becoming increasingly hostile. Matchday police and commanders do an incredibly difficult job but it is vital that the tactics are proportionate and there is trust and extensive dialogue between fans and the police.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for South Yorkshire police said the force could not comment further than Monday\u2019s statement that confirmed a 16-year-old had suffered head injuries, that the incident had been referred to the IOPC, and said there had been \u201cwider disorder\u201d and appealed for witnesses. In response to concerns, the spokesperson stressed the new neighbourhood policing approach, and that it includes an independent advisory group for supporters.\n\nA spokesperson for the FSA said: \u201cThis incident has the potential to undermine the huge progress that has been made in the policing of football matches. To restore confidence we urge the IOPC to conclude their investigation as swiftly as possible and to make it public at the earliest opportunity.\n\n\u201cWhen there is so much emphasis on the behaviour of supporters, while acknowledging that police officers are rightfully entitled to due process, it is only right they are held to the same high standards.\u201d", "author": ["David Conn"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/uk-sport-launches-review-into-uk-athletics", "published": "2020-02-11T18:04:37", "title": "UK Sport launches review into ailing UK Athletics amid \u2018major concerns\u2019", "text": "\u2022 Review aims to make athletics governing body \u2018fit for the future\u2019 \u2022 UK Athletics in disarray following a series of crises and scandals\n\nUK Sport has begun an unprecedented comprehensive review into UK Athletics after admitting it had \u201cmajor concerns\u201d following a series of crises, scandals and poor decisions that have plunged the organisation into disarray.\n\nThe independent review, which comes only five months before the Tokyo Olympics, will examine \u201cthe strategy, leadership, governance, operation, culture and connectivity of UK Athletics\u201d to ensure it is \u201cfit for the future\u201d.\n\nRunning reaches crossroads as Nike-led footwear arms race infects mainstream | Jonathan Liew Read more\n\nUK Sport, which has funded UK Athletics to the tune of \u00a327m since 2017 in its role overseeing all Olympic sports in Britain and Northern Ireland, has taken the step despite two independent reviews already having been recently commissioned to look at the actions of the organisation.\n\nIn recent months UK Athletics lost its chief executive Zara Hyde Peters before she started in the role when she stepped down after failing to disclose to her local athletics club her husband\u2019s \u201cinappropriate relationship\u201d with a 15-year-old girl. The governing body also faced intense criticism over its relationship with the coach Alberto Salazar, who is appealing against a four-year ban for doping offences.\n\nTo make matters worse, UK Athletics has also lost its performance director and chair, failed to hit its medal target at the recent world championships, and has a \u00a32m hole in its finances following the decision to stage the 2018 World Cup on the same weekend as the Wimbledon finals and football World Cup.\n\nThe competence of UK Athletics was also questioned after it named a reserve shot putter into the line up of the men\u2019s 4x400m team at the 2019 European Athletics Team Championships \u2013 leading to the team to be disqualified from the race.\n\nThe sport\u2019s governing body also suffered an embarrassing logistics failure ahead of last year\u2019s world championships after hammer thrower Nick Miller had to relocate away from the team holding camp in Dubai because there were inadequate facilities.\n\nAnnouncing the review, UK Sport said UK Athletics had faced a series of significant challenges that had \u201chad an adverse impact on both the sport and the reputation of the sport\u201d.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nIn an unusually strong statement the UK Sport chief executive, Sally Munday, said: \u201cIssues raised in recent months regarding the sport are of major concern to both UK Sport and to the leadership team at UK Athletics.

Average incomes are around \u00a31,100 lower than in a typical Tory seat, at \u00a323,400 a year, yet Labour constituencies still rank as the poorest, with typical incomes of just \u00a322,400.\n\nRather than being old, as observed by some analysts, the Resolution Foundation said the seats were firmly middle-aged, with the average resident aged 41.

It also found older people in the poorest areas have 35% more spent on them by the NHS than older people in the richest areas.\n\nBut the report also found that up to 75% of new cases of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, 40% of cancer incidence and dementia risks could be reduced if we cut smoking, unhealthy diet, harmful consumption of alcohol and insufficient physical activity.\n\n\u201cThis report describes both a shocking current picture \u2013 and an optimistic future one,\u201d said Damian Green, MP and chair of the APPG for Longevity. \u201cWhat is shocking is that far too many citizens get prematurely ill with illnesses that could have been avoided.

Show Hide What is universal credit? Universal credit (UC) is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, rolling together six benefits into one, online-only system. The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work. About 2 million people are currently in receipt of UC. More than 6 million will be on the benefit by the time it is fully rolled out. How long has it been around? The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of management failures, expensive IT blunders and design faults mean it is now seven years behind schedule, and rollout will not be complete until 2024. The government admitted that the delay was caused in part by claimants being too scared to sign up to the new benefit. What is the biggest problem? The original design set out a minimum 42-day wait for a first payment to claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to rent arrears and evictions, hunger (food banks in UC areas report notable increases in referrals), use of expensive credit and mental distress. Ministers have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks. Are there other problems? Plenty. Multibillion-pound cuts to work allowances imposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than \u00a31,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives.\n\nLandlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It's also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access.\n\nAnd there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a critical study found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.\n\nIt called on the government to increase the level of support to make it simpler for vulnerable people to make a claim before the next phase of the universal credit programme later this year, when about 750,000 ill and disabled benefit claimants start to be moved on to the benefit.\n\n\u201cRolling out universal credit in its current form will steamroll vulnerable people into poverty, but the government has time to turn this around by accepting our recommendations and making it easier to apply,\u201d said Rebecca Keating, the Salvation Army\u2019s employment director said.\n\nThere is concern among campaigners and even the government\u2019s own social security advisers that the government has not done enough to ensure vulnerable claimants do not fall out of the system altogether when they are transferred to universal credit in the process called managed migration, which is due to start in late autumn.\n\nClaimants with mental health problems, learning disabilities and physical disabilities, as well as homeless people were especially at risk, it said. Some lacked computer skills, or could not access the internet because they did not own a smart phone or because there was no public computer nearby.\n\nThe charity cited the case of Daniel, a young man with dyslexia, who struggled to read and write. He had his benefits stopped and ended up homeless after putting the wrong phone number on his online form and missing a text appointment with the job centre.\n\nAlthough Daniel was allocated a key worker he said the extent of his dyslexia was never fully understood. \u201cI needed things explained to me properly and I couldn\u2019t read all the leaflets he was giving me to go away with. That went on for six months,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government\u2019s own figures showed one in five online claims were dropped before they were completed, the Salvation Army said, suggesting 20% of people who were eligible for universal credit because of low pay or unemployment were effectively dropping out of the benefit system.\n\nSome of those who managed to sign up to universal credit subsequently dropped out after being sanctioned for failing to keep up with its tough conditionality requirements, such as 35 hours a week of online job searches. These rules, known as claimant commitments, often did not take a person\u2019s vulnerabilities into account\n\nAbout 85% of those interviewed reported problems signing up to universal credit. Of those, 42% said mental ill health was a barrier. The charity said that overstretched job centres were failing to identify vulnerable people and offer them appropriate support, while government help to claim programmes could not meet demand.\n\nThe charity insisted it wanted universal credit to be a success, but it had a duty to point out where it was going wrong. \u201cThis is not just another paper for decision-makers to ignore and label as scaremongering,\u201d it said. \u201cThese are people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying \u2018bin universal credit, it\u2019s no good\u2019; this is about us wanting to make the system work,\u201d said Keating. \u201cDigital works for a lot of people but there is a significant group of people that it is not working for.\u201d\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions said that although 98% of people make their claim for universal credit online, people who struggled with computers were able to make a claim in person or over the phone. Extra support was available through the Help to Claim service, delivered by Citizens Advice.\n\nA DWP spokesperson said: \u201cJobcentres across the UK have staff trained in supporting vulnerable people and tailor people\u2019s benefit claims to match their circumstances, including taking into account mental health, issues with domestic abuse and homelessness.\u201d\n\nThe Salvation Army\u2019s research was based on interviews between March and June 2019 with 160 people across England and Wales who were out of work and looking for a job and had signed up to the charity\u2019s Employment Plus programme.", "author": ["Patrick Butler"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/12/uk-army-years-off-full-strength-despite-recruitment-drive", "published": "2020-02-12T00:01:17", "title": "UK army 'years off' full strength despite recruitment drive", "text": "Successful Snowflake campaign has helped military hit annual target for first time in six years\n\nArmy recruiters have conceded it will take several years to get the British army near to full strength despite the perceived success of its Snowflake ad campaign, which has helped it to reach its annual target for the first time in six years.\n\nEnlisting had collapsed after recruitment was part-privatised in 2012 when Capita partnered the army but new figures showed that 99% of the year\u2019s 9,440 target had been signed up with seven weeks to go.\n\nSuccessful advertising, popular TV programmes and a relaxation of health requirements are among the measures that have helped but recruiters warned a single year\u2019s performance would do little to reduce the overall shortfall.\n\nMaj Gen Paul Nanson, who heads army recruitment, said it was \u201cgoing to take years\u201d to get back to the levels needed, with current figures showing the shortfall is a little over 8,000 on the target of 82,000.

The Reykjavik native started 10 straight games for Binghamton early in the season but his minutes have decreased.\n\n\u201cI think I'm progressing all right but I'm not doing as well as I could. I have to be patient,\u201d he said.\n\nHjalmarsson said he might not be playing college ball if he hadn't been selected for an NBA-sponsored Basketball Without Borders camp in Finland four years ago. He met a scout who helps international players connect with college coaches, and Binghamton was among the first to show interest.\n\n\u201cComing here, I didn't think I would have to adjust to anything because I just thought it was basketball,\u201d Hjalmarsson said. \u201cAfter being here a few months, it's a completely different sport. Not being able to hand check at all. I'm seeing all these illegal screens being called. It's more physical (in Iceland) but I think guys here are more athletic, they're faster, they jump higher.\u201d\n\nBeing so far away from home, the three players lean on each other for support. And they never forget from where they came.\n\n\u201cYou always think about who you're representing, coming from such a small country,\u201d Gudmundsson said. \u201cMy town is like 3,000 people. Everybody knows me and I know everybody in the town. This is like a beautiful thing, to come here and show the world what I can do and perform on the court.

It's just the nature of the beast.\u201d\n\nKreider may be bracing for a trade that seems inevitable. The NHL standings suggest the Rangers, New Jersey Devils, Ottawa Senators, Detroit Red Wings and Los Angeles Kings are clear sellers ahead of the Feb. 24 trade deadline.\n\nWhile Kreider is the biggest name likely on the move, there is no shortage of talent available. New Jersey\u2019s Sami Vatanen and Wayne Simmonds, Ottawa\u2019s Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Ron Hainsey, Detroit\u2019s Mike Green and Trevor Daley, and Los Angeles\u2019 Tyler Toffoli and Trevor Lewis are all pending free agents.\n\nThere is also Senators forward Anthony Duclair who can be a restricted free agent, and Kings defenseman Alec Martinez is drawing interest with a year left on his contract. The Kings have already traded goaltender Jack Campbell and forward Kyle Clifford to Toronto and made no secret they are open for business.\n\n\u201cWe all signed up for the plan,\u201d first-year Kings coach Todd McLellan said. \u201cWe know where we're going with the team and what we want to do with it. So, none of this approach to the deadline has been a shocker to us as a coaching staff.\u201d\n\nDuclair was traded three times his first five NHL seasons, so his approach hasn\u2019t changed despite being in the midst of an impressive comeback year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through it for a couple of years in a row now,\u201d Duclair said. \u201cI just try to focus on the team and I just try to win, help the team win as many games as possible and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d\n\nA Massachusetts native who played at Boston College, Kreider has been linked to the Bruins and the Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues, who have more than stayed afloat amid significant forward injuries.\n\nHe said last month at All-Star weekend that the Rangers winning games would go a long way to keeping the group together. Despite five victories in seven games after the break, New York is still nine points back of a playoff position and Kreider is almost certainly gone unless he signs an extension.\n\nThe same goes for Lewis, who might be the perfect kind of low-risk deadline pickup that has proven to be the blueprint for recent Cup winners. Kings general manager Rob Blake is attempting to quickly rebuild, but players are in wait-and-see mode.\n\n\u201cI talk to my agent quite a bit, but it's kind of up to them with what they want to do,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cObviously when you play your whole career somewhere, I'm sure they know you'd like to stay.

Under the NCAA's timeline, athletes would be able to take advantage of endorsement opportunities beginning next January.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 25 states are considering legislation that would force the NCAA to allow players to earn money off their personal brand in a bid to address inequities in the multi-billion-dollar college sports industry. California passed a law last year that gives broad endorsement rights to players and it will take effect in 2023. Other states could grant those rights as soon as this year.\n\nThe NCAA's concern, echoed by Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby, who also testified Tuesday, is that endorsement deals for athletes would have a negative effect on recruiting, with schools and boosters in states with athlete-friendly laws using money to entice players to sign with certain schools.\n\n\u201cIf implemented, these laws would give some schools an unfair recruiting advantage and open the door to sponsorship arrangements being used as a recruiting inducement. This would create a huge imbalance among schools and could lead to corruption in the recruiting process,\u201d Emmert said. \u201cWe may need Congress' support in helping maintain uniform standards in college sports.\u201d\n\nEmmert's comments were similar to what the NCAA, the Big 12 and the Atlantic Coast Conference have been communicating to Congress through well-paid lobbyists. The Associated Press has found that the NCAA and the two conferences spent $750,000 last year lobbying on Capitol Hill, in part to amplify their concern that \u201cguardrails\u201d are needed on endorsement pay for athletes to avoid destroying college sports as we know it.\n\nSen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Manufacturing, Trade, and Consumer Protection, said he was not inclined to act until after the NCAA reveals its new rules.\n\n\u201cI wish Congress was in a position to be able to provide the NCAA and the athletes the opportunity to find a solution. ... The ability for Congress to do that is, that's a challenge,\u201d Moran said in an interview after the hearing. \u201cThe next step is to see what the NCAA is capable of presenting to us in April.\u201d\n\nNCAA critics believe there is plenty of evidence that recruiting is already corrupt \u2014 pointing in part to the federal criminal case involving shoe companies paying basketball players to attend schools they sponsor \u2014 and that letting players earn endorsement money won't create the major problems the NCAA predicts.\n\nRamogi Huma, executive director of the National College Players' Association, which advocates for athletes' rights, said under current NCAA rules, 99.3% of top-100 football recruits choose teams from the Power Five conferences.\n\n\u201cThe power conferences have advantages and they consistently pull the best recruits,\u201d Huma said. \u201cThey will continue to get the recruits. The reality is, you're not going to change the recruiting by limiting the players' opportunities.\u201d\n\nHuma said once states start granting players endorsement rights, Congress would not be inclined to take those rights away, \u201cand we'll have an opportunity to witness the fact that NCAA sports will still be strong and everybody will tune in.\u201d\n\nThere was bipartisan agreement among the senators at the hearing that athletes should have access to endorsement opportunities and that some regulations are necessary.\n\nEmmert did not fully escape lawmakers' anger at the system he presides over.\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, excoriated Emmert for the NCAA's handling of sexual violence against women. She also noted the case of James Wiseman, a top NBA prospect who left school after he was suspended over $11,500 given to his mother by Memphis coach Penny Hardaway to help with moving expenses. Hardaway gave the money before he was Memphis' coach.\n\nBlackburn said the NCAA's lack of consistency and transparency in the Wiseman case had eroded trust in the organization's ability to handle issues of player benefits.\n\n\u201cI think a question that must be going through a lot of minds of student-athletes and their parents is, how in the world are they going to be able to trust you to get this right?\u201d Blackburn said.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dosunmu-hurt-after-spartans-late-dunk-no-22-illini-fall", "published": "2020-02-12T11:41:00", "title": "Dosunmu hurt after Spartans' late dunk; No. 22 Illini fall", "text": "Illinois suffered two brutal losses by the final horn Tuesday night.\n\nStar guard Ayo Dosunmu crumbled to the floor clutching his left knee moments after Michigan State's Xavier Tillman threw down a huge dunk that lifted the Spartans over the 22nd-ranked Illini 70-69.\n\nIllinois did not provide an update on Dosunmu's status, but coach Brad Underwood said \u201cthe outcome of the game is secondary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get a knot in my stomach when one of our guys goes down like that,\" he added. \"We don\u2019t know anything right now.

Although Warren never got out of the low minors as a pitcher, he was maybe the fastest runner in the organization.\n\nMaddon unsuccessfully tried to persuade Angels general manager Dan O'Brien to let Warren play in the field at a time when serious two-way play had been abandoned for decades. Now that Shohei Ohtani has emphatically brought it back, Maddon is thrilled to be on the vanguard again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been intrigued by that,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought it\u2019s something that should be looked into more deeply.\u201d\n\nMaddon has prided himself on being willing to be an innovator and an unconventional thinker for his entire career. He isn't narrowing his mind as he heads into the first season of his homecoming with the Angels.\n\nOhtani's unique progress is among Maddon's most important concerns over the next six weeks in Arizona, along with the evolution of a starting rotation that will hopefully include Ohtani before Memorial Day.\n\nThe Angels are targeting mid-May for Ohtani's return to the big-league mound, general manager Billy Eppler revealed Tuesday while pitchers and catchers reported to Tempe Diablo Stadium. Ohtani will be available as a designated hitter on opening day, but he will take days away from the big-league team to make rehab pitching starts in the minors.\n\nEppler and Ohtani have detailed plans for the two-way star's final comeback from Tommy John surgery and subsequent offseason knee surgery, which pushed back his pitching progress. Maddon is on board with the plans, but he also intends to make decisions by speaking face-to-face with Ohtani.\n\n\u201cI think patience is a key word with all of this,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in development my whole life, so when you\u2019re trying to develop a major league talent like him here, coming off the injury situations that he\u2019s had, it\u2019s important to be very patient, and I am.\u201d\n\nAngels owner Arte Moreno's patience has clearly worn a bit thin after four consecutive losing seasons and a decade without a playoff victory. Right after Maddon and the Cubs parted ways in September, Moreno abruptly fired manager Brad Ausmus and eagerly pursued Maddon to return to the club where he won the first of his two World Series rings as Mike Scioscia's bench coach.\n\nMaddon took the job, but he isn't here to ease into retirement. He isn't even the oldest manager in the game anymore with 70-year-old Dusty Baker's arrival in Houston.\n\nMaddon already has had dinner with many of his new Angels, and he is getting to know the rest in Tempe. He admires pitcher Julio Teheran's adventurous new haircut, and he is excited about the depth of the Halos' young talent,\n\n\"Jimmie Reese remained contemporary, and that\u2019s why he was able to do this until he was 93,\" Maddon said, evoking the memory of the beloved longtime Angels coach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between accepting what\u2019s going on right now and remaining contemporary, or pushing back to the point where you do become a dinosaur or archaic,\" he added. \"You do connect with people, regardless of their age. And how do you do that? By taking an interest in what they do, where they\u2019re coming from. Once you\u2019ve established that momentum, then you can influence.\u201d\n\nMaddon is living in the moment and planning for the future. But his return to the Angels has still brought on waves of memories, both here in Tempe and back in Southern California, where he and his wife will settle back into the house they left behind in Long Beach.\n\nMaddon plans to use spring training as a chance to find a balance between the past and the present so he can focus on the Angels' future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved this place,\u201d Maddon said of modest Tempe Diablo Stadium and the complex which housed the Mariners a few decades ago. \u201cSo I remember having meetings down below in that little clubhouse, talking about instructional league stuff.

Rather, he urged bishops to pray for more priestly vocations and send missionaries to the region, where the faithful living in remote communities can go months or even years without Mass.\n\nFrancis\u2019 dodging of the issue disappointed progressives, who had hoped he would at the very least put it to further study. And it relieved conservatives who have used the debate over priestly celibacy to heighten opposition to the pope, whom some have accused of heresy.\n\nPOPE FRANCIS PROPOSES FEMALE DEACONS, MARRIED PRIESTS AT AMAZON SYNOD\n\nThe bulk of the document, \u201cBeloved Amazon,\u201d is instead a love letter to the Amazonian rain forest and its indigenous peoples, penned by history\u2019s first Latin American pope who has long been concerned about the violent exploitation of the land, the Amazon's crucial importance to the global ecosystem and the injustices committed against its peoples.\n\nHe addressed the document to all peoples of the world \u201cto help awaken their affection and concern for that land which is also ours and to invite them to value it and acknowledge it as a sacred mystery.\u201d\n\nIt is in many ways a synthesized and focused version of Francis\u2019 2015 landmark environmental encyclical, \u201cPraised Be,\u201d in which he blasted wealthy countries and multinational corporations for destroying the world\u2019s natural resources and impoverishing the poor for their own profit.\n\nFrancis said he has four dreams for the Amazon: that the rights of the poor are respected, that their cultural riches are celebrated, that the Amazon\u2019s natural beauty and life are preserved, and that its Christian communities show Amazonian features.\n\nFrancis had convened bishops from the Amazon\u2019s nine countries for a three-week meeting in October to debate the ways the church can help preserve the delicate ecosystem from global warming and better minister to the region\u2019s people, many of whom live in isolated communities or in poverty in cities.\n\nVP MIKE PENCE MEETS POPE FRANCIS IN PRIVATE AUDIENCE AT VATICAN\n\nThe Argentine Jesuit has long been sensitive to the plight of the Amazon, where Protestant and Pentecostal churches are wooing away Catholic souls in the absence of vibrant Catholic communities where the Eucharist can be regularly celebrated.\n\nIn their final document at the end of the October synod, the majority of bishops called for the establishment of criteria so that \u201crespected\u201d married men in their communities who have already served as permanent deacons be ordained as priests.\n\nIn addition, the bishops called for the Vatican to reopen a study commission on ordaining women as deacons, a type of ministry in the church that allows for preaching, celebrating weddings and baptisms, but not consecrating the Eucharist. Francis had created such a commission in 2016 at the insistence of religious sisters who want more say and roles in church governance and ministry, but the group ended its work without reaching consensus.\n\nFrancis didn\u2019t mention either proposal in \u201cBeloved Amazon\u201d and didn\u2019t cite the synod\u2019s final document in his text or in a single footnote. But he did say in his introduction that he wanted to \u201cofficially present\u201d the synod\u2019s final document and urged the faithful to read it in full, suggesting that he at least valued the input.\n\nFrancis did echo many of the synod\u2019s recommendations, calling for greater lay participation in the life of the church and saying the training of priests in the Amazon must be overhauled so they are more able to minister to indigenous peoples. He said \u201cevery effort should be made\u201d to give the faithful access to the Eucharist.\n\n\u201cThis urgent need leads me to urge all bishops, especially those in Latin America, not only to promote prayer for priestly vocations, but also to be more generous in encouraging those who display a missionary vocation to opt for the Amazon region,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFrancis dismissed suggestions that ordaining women to any ministry would serve them or the church. While agreeing that women should have greater decision-making and governance roles, Francis argued that they must find \u201cother forms of service and charisms that are proper to women.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic Church retains the priesthood for men, arguing that Christ and his apostles were male. While Eastern rite branches have married priests, and Anglican and Protestant priest converts can be married, the Roman rite church has had a tradition of priestly celibacy since the 11th century, imposed in part for financial reasons to ensure that priests' assets pass to the church, not to heirs.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the document\u2019s release, the question of a celibate priesthood made headlines after the publication of a book penned by the retired pope, Benedict, and a conservative Vatican official, Cardinal Robert Sarah, reaffirmed the \u201cnecessity\u201d of a celibate priesthood.\n\nBenedict\u2019s participation in the book sparked controversy, since it appeared the retired pope was trying to influence the thinking of the current one, despite his promises to remain \u201chidden from the world\u201d when he resigned seven years ago.\n\nFrancis dodged the issue altogether, dedicating instead the entire first half of the document to the \u201cinjustice and crime\u201d committed against the Amazonian peoples and its environment by local governments and foreign corporate interests, illegal mining and extraction industries.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow globalization to become a new version of colonialism,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe said the church in the Amazon must have social justice at the forefront of its spirituality, saying ministry that focuses excessively on discipline and rules will turn people away when in fact they need \u201cunderstanding, comfort and acceptance.\u201d\n\nHe called for the church to incorporate indigenous traditions and cultures into its ministry, including song and dance, myth and festivals, and urged patience when confronted with apparently pagan practices and symbols.\n\nIt was a reference to the controversy that punctuated the synod over the appearance in the Vatican of wooden statutes of a pregnant woman that critics said were pagan idols. At one point, a conservative activist stole the statues from a Vatican-area church and threw them in the Tiber River in a videotaped stunt that galvanized traditionalist opposition to Francis and the synod itself.\n\nIn his document, Francis said indigenous practices and symbols should not be written off immediately as superstition, paganism or idolatry.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cA missionary of souls will try to discover the legitimate needs and concerns that seek an outlet in at times imperfect, partial or mistaken religious expressions, and will attempt to respond to them with an inculturated spirituality,\u201d Francis wrote.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.foxnews.com/sports/panthers-owner-says-cam-newtons-future-depends-on-health", "published": "2020-02-12T11:25:57", "title": "Panthers owner says Cam Newton's future depends on health", "text": "Panthers owner David Tepper remains noncommittal on Cam Newton's future with the organization, saying it will largely depend on how the quarterback recovers from foot surgery.\n\n\u201cListen, I'm not a doctor,\u201d Tepper said Tuesday. \u201cI said it a million times, is he healthy?

Bruce Westerman: Our most advanced carbon-capture device? Trees", "text": "Take a moment to think back to your eighth-grade science class. Do you remember painstakingly coloring in the diagram of a plant cell? Words like \u201cmitochondria\u201d and \u201cribosome\u201d may bring back vivid memories of trying to cram everything in the night before a test. But there\u2019s one particular part of a cell upon which every ecosystem in the world depends: the chloroplast. Right now, countless billions of chloroplasts in trees across the world are turning water, sunlight and carbon dioxide into plant food and releasing oxygen back into the atmosphere.\n\nWhy is any of this important? Because this common, everyday occurrence is the most advanced carbon-capture device we have. The carbon that leaf cells are pulling from the atmosphere remains in the tree, even after it\u2019s cut down and used for wood products like furniture, building materials and more.\n\nWe are at a point in history where we need a bold goal to focus our efforts on being the best stewards of our environment. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing that we lead the world in planting 1 trillion trees globally by 2050.\n\nGOP LOOKS TO COUNTER GREEN NEW DEAL WITH THREE-PRONGED CLIMATE CHANGE PLAN: REPORT\n\nMy bill \u2013 the Trillion Trees Act \u2013 is a three-pronged approach:\n\n1) Plant more trees in urban areas and on marginal agriculture land domestically while offering technical support and assistance for other countries to maximize forest growth internationally and reverse deforestation.\n\n2) Grow more wood in our existing forests and make them more resilient to insects, diseases and catastrophic wildfires.\n\n3) Store more carbon by incentivizing innovative building practices with a sustainable building tax credit, while offsetting some fossil fuel use by capturing the energy in renewable biomass fuel.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThis idea stems from a 2019 Swiss report featured by the American Academy of the Advancement of Science that estimated planting 1 trillion trees could sequester 205 gigatonnes of carbon worldwide. That\u2019s the equivalent of two-thirds of all manmade carbon since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nTrees are much more powerful than people assume. Codifying an aggressive planting goal into law is the most natural, pragmatic and economical approach. And as it turns out, planting a trillion new trees is not out of reach. According to statisticians, planet earth is currently home to 3 trillion trees, with about 10 percent of those trees growing in the U.S. We\u2019re already planting 2.5 billion new trees in the U.S. each year, so we could plant our fair share over that 30-year window by increasing the yearly U.S. planting to 3.3 billion. It\u2019s aggressive, but doable.\n\nBut we can do more. Actually, we can do much more. While our planet has limited available space for forests, there is no limit to how much carbon trees can pull from the atmosphere and store, both in forests and in wood products. In fact, 40-50 percent of dry wood by weight is carbon. Think of forests, wood buildings and other wood products as an above-ground storage system for carbon that was once stored in coal seams and oil reservoirs.\n\nWhile our goal is to plant a trillion trees, the bill is about more than just planting and preventing deforestation. We need to simultaneously be harvesting billions of trees and manufacturing that wood to fully utilize forests\u2019 capacity to remove and store carbon. It may seem counterintuitive, but we know it\u2019s possible to sustainably harvest timber while increasing the amount of forests. It\u2019s happening all around us in the United States today, where our total forest volume is increasing even as our use of wood products grows. In my home state of Arkansas, we\u2019re replanting four trees for every one tree that we harvest, and the amount of standing timber significantly increases every year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe benefits of this approach are numerous: reforesting deforested and urban areas, increasing the amount of carbon-carrying capacity, protecting old-growth forests from catastrophic deforestation events and experiencing the added benefits of healthy, vibrant forests. All of this can be done in a positive way that not only benefits the environment but also the economy, especially rural economies in which forests are often located.\n\nThis is not the bill that does everything, but it\u2019s the bill that does the most. Using trees as a carbon sequestration device is a proven concept that\u2019s reliable and efficient. Now it\u2019s our responsibility to teach future generations how to grow healthy forests. We have both a literal and a metaphorical opportunity to fulfill the Greek proverb that states, \u201cA society becomes great when old men plant trees in whose shade they know they shall never sit.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., narrowly won with almost 26 percent of the vote, followed closely by former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg in second-place with just over 24 percent, with 87 percent of precincts reporting.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota came in a strong third with almost 20 percent, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts trailed at a distant fourth with just over 9 percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden was in fifth place with just over 8 percent. No other candidate managed to reach even 4 percent of the vote.\n\nONE: Polls can be reliable\n\nMost polls \u2013 especially the most recent polls \u2013 showed Sanders leading or winning in New Hampshire. The polls were accurate, though Buttigieg came close to scoring an upset.\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE GIVES KLOBUCHAR MAJOR BOOST, PUTS BIDEN AND WARREN ON 2020 LIFE SUPPORT\n\nTWO: The fat lady hasn't sung yet\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, but nine candidates remain in a field that once had over two dozen presidential hopefuls.\n\nWhile some candidates at the back of the pack have virtually no chance of winning their party\u2019s nomination, I wouldn\u2019t count out Warren and Biden. I agree with their decision to stay in the race.\n\nAs Biden said: \"It ain't over man, we're just getting started.\u201d\n\nThe Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary are important because they are the first two nominating contests. But the two states have small populations with few African-American and Hispanic voters. The next two nominating contests \u2013 in Nevada Feb. 22 and South Carolina Feb. 29 \u2013 are in states with much more diverse populations, where Biden, in particular, has enjoyed strong support.\n\nThen comes Super Tuesday on March 3, when voters in Alabama, American Samoa, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia cast ballots for their choice for the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nThe results in all these states won\u2019t necessarily mirror the results in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nBut just because Biden is carrying on doesn\u2019t mean he should carry on this campaign the same way. Something has to change.\n\nBiden has to step up his game in the debates and reevaluate why he once topped the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire but then fell flat when voting was held.\n\nThe former vice president needs to change it up to get more people to come out and vote for him by getting them more excited about his candidacy. He can't just count on states like South Carolina with large minority populations.\n\nSignificantly, new polling shows former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg's is picking up support among African-Americans \u2013 a constituency that has been strongly supportive of Biden in earlier polls.\n\nTHREE: Endorsements matter\n\nI have always maintained that endorsements don't really do much for campaigns, but boy, was I wrong this time around in New Hampshire. I\u2019m specifically referring to the endorsements Sanders received from Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.\n\nThe endorsement of the three progressive freshmen congresswomen gave Sanders an important boost that contributed to his New Hampshire victory.\n\nFOUR: The Democratic Party is divided\n\nAmong the top five candidates in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, Sanders and Warren competed in the progressive lane, together getting just over 35 percent of the vote.\n\nButtigieg, Klobuchar and Biden competed for the more moderate vote, and together captured almost 53 percent of the vote.\n\nThe remaining vote was split between candidates in the back of the pack.\n\nBloomberg \u2013 spending record amounts of his multibillion-dollar fortune on his campaign \u2013 wasn\u2019t on the ballot in Iowa and New Hampshire but is campaigning and advertising heavily in Super Tuesday states.\n\nFIVE: Old school low-tech voting is best\n\nNew Hampshire used paper ballots. The primary went off without a hitch and results came in early \u2013 quite a contrast to the failure of new technology used to tabulate votes in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nApps and computers can be hacked and break down. That can\u2019t happen with good old-fashioned paper ballots.\n\nSIX: Warren made a mistake picking a fight with Sanders\n\nWarren was leading in polls in New Hampshire just a few weeks ago. Then she started a feud with Sanders, claiming he had told her in private that a female candidate couldn\u2019t defeat President Trump in the November election \u2013 a claim Sanders strongly denied.\n\nThe feud appears to have cost Warren votes \u2013 exactly the opposite effect she likely expected.\n\nWarren\u2019s poor showing in New Hampshire is especially embarrassing for her because her home state of Massachusetts borders New Hampshire and that should have given her a geographical advantage. Sanders is also from a neighboring state \u2013 Vermont.\n\nSEVEN: Delegates count\n\nIn the New Hampshire primary, Sanders and Buttigieg each picked up nine delegates to the Democratic National Convention, which Klobuchar picked up six. No other Democratic picked up a single delegate. So while Sanders won slightly more popular votes, the contest was a draw between him and Buttigieg in the delegate count.\n\nEIGHT: There was no surge in voter turnout\n\nPolling showed that New Hampshire Democratic voters are angry and want the Democratic Party to nominate a candidate who can defeat President Trump in November.\n\nBut in Iowa and New Hampshire we didn\u2019t see the record turnout for the Democratic caucuses and primaries that some had forecast.\n\nDemocrats will need a strong turnout of anti-Trump voters to have a chance of defeating him in the general election.\n\nNINE: Candidate debates matter\n\nWith the exception of Bloomberg, who hasn\u2019t yet qualified for a presidential candidate debate and wasn\u2019t on the ballot in Iowa and New Hampshire, candidates kept of the debate stage have fared poorly and many dropped out before voting in nominating contests began.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe televised debates give the candidates valuable exposure and boost their status as serious contenders.\n\nKlobuchar had a breakout performance at the Democratic debate last week and that seems to have been a big factor that helped her vault past Biden and Warren in the New Hampshire primary.\n\nTEN: Health care wins again\n\nHealth care is a winning issue for Democrats. As President Trump and Republicans seek to constantly undo ObamaCare and have no alternative plan, this is an issue that still is strongly resonating with voters.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPolling shows that health care, followed by climate change, followed by the desire for a president who can unite our country are the three big concerns of many voters.\n\nIn New Hampshire, polls show 6 in 10 voters concerned about health care support a government-sponsored program like Medicare-for-all.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LESLIE MARSHALL", "author": ["Leslie Marshall", "Leslie Marshall Joined Fox News Channel As A Contributor In", "Providing Analysis On Both Political", "Social Issues A Liberal Point Of View.

Michael Bennet of Colorado dropped out of the race Tuesday night after poor performances in New Hampshire and in the Iowa caucuses last week, but nine Democrats remain in the nomination battle, preventing any one candidate from garnering a majority of the primary votes.\n\nSANDERS EDGES OUT BUTTIGIEG TO WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AS KLOBUCHAR SURGES TO THIRD\n\nSanders\u2019 victory tells us he is gaining momentum among a small plurality of Democratic primary and caucus voters in the opening rounds of the competition to become the Democratic nominee who will run against President Trump in November.\n\nWith 86 percent of precincts reporting, Sanders had close to 26 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire Democratic primary \u2013 a far cry from the 60 percent he received when he defeated Hillary Clinton in the Granite State in 2016. Buttigieg had just over 24 percent and Klobuchar had almost 20 percent.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden trailed far back in fourth and fifth place. Neither Warren nor Biden could reach 10 percent of the vote \u2013 far below what had been expected of them early in the nomination race. No other candidate could reach even 4 percent.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results indicate that the badly splintered Democrats should be concerned about their sluggish voter turnout to date and their deep divisions.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s razor-thin victory in the delegate count in the Iowa caucuses last week (if you trust the Democrats counting the votes), coupled with his strong showing in New Hampshire certainly makes for good campaign talking points, but should not be misconstrued. While he came close to winning in New Hampshire, he still wound up with the silver medal.\n\nUntil last month, 38-year old former Indiana mayor was in charge of a city with a population of only about 100,000. While Buttigieg has demonstrated over the past year that he\u2019s capable of delivering a canned stump speech and raising money, he\u2019s far from a political phenomenon. In fact, when you consider his scant record of accomplishment, he\u2019s mediocre at best.\n\nIt\u2019s only the historically weak Democratic field this year that allows a candidate like Buttigieg to gain oxygen. How would Buttigieg have fared in Democratic primary fields from the past like the ones that consisted of Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey in 2000, or Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts and Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina in 2004, or Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York in 2008? I think everyone knows the answer to that \u2013 including Pete Buttigieg.\n\nKlobuchar beat expectations in the primary with her third-place finish, beating both Warren and Biden by a wide margin.\n\nWarren\u2019s distant fourth-place finish will likely spell an early doom for the candidacy of the leftist former Harvard professor.\n\nKlobuchar, first elected to the Senate in 2006, is a prototypical liberal backbencher who has done nothing of significance on the national stage. She is perhaps best known for the episode when she apparently ate a salad with a comb on an airplane due to a forgotten plastic fork and had a staffer wash the comb after the meal.\n\nThe New York Times report on this bizarre tale had staff members describing Klobuchar\u2019s treatment of her employees as \u201cdehumanizing.\u201d Likeability still matters in politics and that could spell big trouble for Klobuchar as rival Democratic campaigns start their in-depth opposition research of her past.\n\nThe oxygen for Buttigieg and Klobuchar is being provided in large part by the monumental implosion of Biden\u2019s campaign. In just a matter of weeks, Biden has gone from experienced frontrunner to washed-up has-been.\n\nFor the third time since 1988, Biden has proven \u2013 in sleepy and at times disturbing fashion \u2013 that he doesn\u2019t have what it takes to become president. It appears he will continue on to run in nominating contests in Nevada and South Carolina at the end of the month, but his campaign is flat-lining and everyone knows it.\n\nWhen the Biden candidacy soon to be over, he and his son Hunter should get their stories straight about their corrupt antics in Ukraine before they go talk to investigators in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThese are desperate times for the Democrats, as they see President Trump\u2019s approval rating in polls tick upward and his campaign raise record amounts of money in the process of building an extraordinary 50-state organization.\n\nDemocrats are so anxious about the November elections that they are taking a look at the hopelessly out-of-touch and completely uninspiring former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to pick up their drooping flag.\n\nFormer Republican Bloomberg is the consummate political opportunist and a phony. He was an ardent supporter of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policing until he decided he was going to run for president as a liberal in the mold of current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s contrived left-wing proposals are as stale and tired as the man himself. The only thing \u201cMike will get done\u201d if he is elected \u2013 to paraphrase his campaign slogan \u2013 is to wreck the booming Trump economy with job-killing tax hikes and overregulation, harming American families.\n\nAccording to a recent Gallup survey, an impressive 59 percent of Americans say that they are better off financially than that they were a year ago and a staggering 74 percent say they\u2019ll be even better off financially a year from now.\n\nThe report, titled \u201cRecord-High Optimism on Personal Finances in U.S.,\u201d is proof positive that the Trump economy is booming and that people are feeling it in their pocketbooks, bank accounts, and 401(k)\u2019s.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s pro-growth economic policies, working in tandem with his businessman\u2019s mindset, are a welcome combination working wonders for America. Trump is a leader who embodies the promise of vibrant free-market capitalism \u2013 the system that has made the American economy the envy of the world once again.\n\nThere is dignity in working hard, having a job, paying taxes, and providing for your family. With a record number of Americans employed \u2013 including record-low unemployment rates in the African-American, Hispanic, and Asian-American communities \u2013 it\u2019s abundantly clear that new opportunities are becoming available to more and more of our citizens every day, whether the anti-Trump media want to acknowledge it or not.\n\nThe Trump agenda is optimistic, inclusive and innovative; and it\u2019s working for all Americans across the board. President John F. Kennedy was right when he said that \u201ca rising tide lifts all boats.\n\nIt goes without saying that JFK would have been greatly disturbed by today\u2019s Democrats\u2019 embrace of socialism, high taxes, and less freedom. These Democrats are backing policies that would kill jobs, take your health care away, and confiscate your guns as they seek to impose their warped socialist agenda on you and your family.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAt the end of the day, Bernie Sanders is all talk and no action.

But I do know that writing political obituaries should be banned after 2016.\n\nBIDEN DOWNPLAYS NEW HAMPSHIRE EXPECTATIONS AFTER REPEATEDLY VOWING TO WIN\n\nBiden has had a terrible couple of weeks and anyone saying otherwise isn\u2019t being an honest broker. He was polling in first or second place in Iowa and came in an unrespectable fourth. Word just got out that he left New Hampshire early to head to South Carolina, leaving his sister behind to manage expectations at his planned celebration party in Nashua, New Hampshire.\n\nIt\u2019s expected that Biden could fall to fifth place in New Hampshire when all the votes are tallied Tuesday evening and he\u2019s suffering from a real cash flow problem. In South Carolina, which is widely accepted as his firewall, Biden isn\u2019t even on the air while the two Democratic billionaires Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg have unlimited advertising resources.\n\nThe newest Quinnipiac poll is rightfully sending shockwaves through Biden world. For the first time, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., comes out on top with 25 percent of the vote share and Biden slipping nine points from the last poll and coming in with 17 percent support. Who is in third? Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who was the write-in winner of the Dixville Notch primary last night and is now ahead of Sanders when it comes to African American support.\n\nPerhaps most critically, Biden\u2019s support from black voters has slipped considerably and is the real cause for concern. In that same Quinnipiac poll, Biden has 27 percent black support down from 49 percent in the January 29 poll.\n\nThat kind of drop explains why he flew off from New Hampshire early to head to South Carolina and talk to his core voting bloc face to face.

Former Vice President Joe Biden is already in South Carolina blowing up plans to watch results come in in New Hampshire. It is the smart move for him as he seeks to keep the narrative that South Carolina is a home game for him.\n\nNot even Biden\u2019s most ardent advocates are predicting anything other than a disaster. The idea that he will be saved in South Carolina is more wishful thinking than reality. Already, multiple polls are showing him sinking like a stone and his support among African Americans dropping. Without that support, he is toast waiting to be buttered. Ultimately, South Carolina is his only chance to breathe life into the effort. At the end of the day, though, his candidacy is done.\n\nJoe Biden is not alone in being finished. Sen Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg should drop out Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. There is no upcoming contest where any of them are positioned to finish first. All three should start prepping for interviews to become the nominee for vice president.\n\nBIDEN ABRUPTLY CANCELS NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY PARTY APPEARANCE, HEADS TO SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSome may view it as premature for Warren, Klobuchar, and Buttigieg to close their campaigns. The reality is any momentum they would get from a stronger than expected finish Tuesday will be short-lived and it is most certainly temporary, as South Carolina is unlikely to be fertile ground for any of them. Moreover, their lane is as an alternative to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The problem here, of course, is that this is exactly the lane that will become dominated by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days and weeks.\n\nProof of the Bloomberg machine driving over political history and precedent is easy to uncover. Already, without any participation in any debate to date, the most recent national poll has him in third place. His rate of spending is something that has never been seen in the history of American politics. The media is falling all over themselves in the excitement that Sanders raised $25 million in January. It appears as though Bloomberg is spending that much in a week on television alone.

It was Trump who refused to shake Pelosi\u2019s hand at the State of the Union address last Monday night and it was Pelosi who tore up her copy of his speech for all to see.\n\nThe co-chairs of the 2020 breakfast, Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.) and Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-N.Y.) spoke of their deep personal relationship and their ability to bridge differences because of it.\n\nArthur Brooks, the former head of the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that researches government, politics, economics, and social welfare, and also a Harvard professor and columnist for The Washington Post, spoke of reconciliation and loving one\u2019s enemies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhen it was President Trump\u2019s turn to speak, he said. \u201cArthur, I don\u2019t know if I agree with you\u201d and then went on a tear proving he didn\u2019t. He criticized those who claim to pray for him and misuse their faith for political ends. He implied that \u201cthose in this room\u201d (more than 3,000 attended) all support him and those who don\u2019t are not genuine Christians.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about reconciliation. It has a power that is the antithesis of political power, which in reality is no power at all. If the person who believes he, or she, has been wronged by another reaches out and offers forgiveness, it can have the effect of disarming the other person and lowering the political and personal temperature.\n\nSince Jesus is at the center of this annual event, the president should consider what He said on the subject of loving one\u2019s enemies: \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? (Matthew 5:43-48).\n\nLest someone think this is only a Christian ideal, consider Proverbs 25:21-22: \u201cIf your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink; For you will heap burning coals on his head. And the Lord will reward you.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn his remarks, Brooks said if people can\u2019t sincerely practice forgiveness and reconciliation, they should \u201cfake it.\u201d His point was that reconciliation has a power all its own, even if one initially is not sincere about it.\n\nPerhaps it is time to suspend this annual event or to hold it without this president attending if he can\u2019t accept the nonpartisan theme that has been its tradition for nearly seven decades. He clearly missed a grand opportunity. It would have cost him nothing to shake Speaker Pelosi\u2019s hand and in doing so he might have heaped coals of fire upon her head if she did not respond in kind.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CAL THOMAS", "author": ["Cal Thomas", "Cal Thomas Is America'S Most Widely Syndicated Op-Ed Columnist In The U.S. He Is The Author Of"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/-7rNlgN4WIk/buttigieg-democrats-abortion-infanticide-trump-newt-gingrich", "published": "2020-02-11T19:30:35", "title": "Newt Gingrich: Buttigieg, other Dems' radical views on abortion, infanticide could lead to a Trump landslide", "text": "It is easy to forget how far Democrats have come from former President Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 commitment that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal, and rare.\u201d\n\nEven as late as 2008, then-Senator Hillary Clinton repeated the formula by affirming that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal, and rare.\u201d\n\nIn recent conversations with voters, Pete Buttigieg has shown how much more radical the Democrats have become on the issues of abortion and infanticide.\n\nKRISTEN DAY: BUTTIGIEG AND 2020 HOPEFULS, DON'T CANCEL 21 MILLION PRO-LIFE DEMS IF YOU WANT TO BEAT TRUMP\n\nKristin Day, a pro-life Democratic voter, recently put Buttigieg on the spot at a Fox News Townhall event in January, when she said: \u201cSo, do you want the support of pro-life Democrats, pro-life Democratic voters? There are about 21 million of us. And if so, would you support more moderate platform language in the Democratic Party to ensure that the party of diversity, of inclusion really does include everybody?\u201d\n\nWhen Buttigieg told her that he was pro-choice and then gave a waffling answer, moderator Chris Wallace asked if Day was satisfied with the answer she received.\n\nShe was not:\n\n\u201cNo, I was not, because he did not answer the second part of my question. And the second part was, the Democratic platform contains language that basically says that we don't belong, we have no part in the party because it says abortion should be legal up to nine months, the government should pay for it, and there's nothing that says that people have a diversity of views on this issue should be included in the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 1996, and I guess several years after that, there was language in the Democratic platform that said that we understand that people have very differing views on this issue, but we are a big tent party that includes everybody. And so, therefore, we welcome you, people like me, into the party so we can work on issues that we agree on.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo my question was, would you be open to language like that in the Democratic platform, that really did say that our party is diverse and inclusive and we want everybody?\u201d\n\nButtigieg\u2019s radical stance on abortion (he said that life begins when a baby takes its first breath, i.e., after being born) approaches the pro-infanticide position of Democratic Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam \u2013 who is, ironically, a pediatric neurologist supposedly dedicated to saving babies.\n\nSpeaking to Washington, D.C. radio station WTOP about late-term abortions, Northam said:\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physician \u2014 more than one physician, by the way \u2014 and it\u2019s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\u2019s non-viable.\n\n\u201cIf a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\u201d\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo also fits perfectly with the abortion-infanticide Democrats. His highest priority in 2019 was enacting the Reproductive Health Act. According to The Washington Times, the law \u201cdecriminalizes abortion and drops most of the state\u2019s previous restrictions on abortions after 24 weeks. It also allows midwives and nurse practitioners to perform abortions.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs the newspaper reported, Cuomo thought passage of the law was so great that One World Trade Center, the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, the Kosciuszko Bridge, and the Alfred E. Smith Building in Albany, \u201cwere lit pink in celebration of the law.\u201d\n\nButtigieg, of course, is not that different from the other Democratic candidates on abortion.\n\nFormer Vice President Biden reversed his position on the Hyde Amendment, which says taxpayers do not have to pay for abortions. By a majority of 57 to 36, Americans agreed in 2016 that their tax dollars should not be used for abortions. Now, Biden is in favor of tax-paid abortions, as well as for a litmus test on the issue of abortion for US Supreme Court nominees.\n\nFormer New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg also aligns closely with the extremist pro-abortion group. When running for mayor, he proposed that anyone studying to be a gynecologist or obstetrician should be forced to learn how to perform abortions. (Under enormous public pressure, he backed off and allowed moral and religious exemptions).\n\nAllow me to answer Day\u2019s question: The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates and the platform they\u2019ll adopt in Milwaukee will be radically pro-abortion \u2013 possibly including Governor Northam\u2019s infanticide phraseology.

It is one thing to say that minorities commit crime at relatively high rates compared to whites, but it is something quite different to falsely claim that minorities commit virtually all murders.\n\nFor a candidate who has already spent an astounding $350 million on his campaign -- more than all of his opponents combined -- it might be hard for his political opponents to get a word in edgewise. But, even as polls are showing that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has the second-highest support among black Democrats, his past racial bias could still get him in trouble. 24 percent of Democratic primary voters are black.\n\n\u201c95 percent of your murders -- murderers and murder victims fit one M.O. You can just take the description, Xerox it, and pass it out to all the cops,\u201d said Bloomberg at an event in Aspen, Colorado in February 2015. \u201cThey are male, minorities, 16 to 25. That's true in New York. That's true in virtually every city\u2026And the way you get the guns out of the kids\u2019 hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them.\u201d\n\nMARTHA MACCALLUM: LEAKED BLOOMBERG AUDIO WILL BE WEAPON FOR 2020 OPPONENTS\n\nIt is amazing that someone who oversaw law enforcement in New York City could really believe that virtually all murderers are young minorities. By tying this in with Stop and Frisk in the same answer, Bloomberg created racist overtones to that enforcement method. The most recent data at the time his comments were made from the 2013 FBI Uniform Crime Reports aren\u2019t at all in line with Bloomberg\u2019s 95 percent figure.\n\nAccording to the FBI data, among murderers whose race we knew, almost 44 percent of murderers were white. Unfortunately, the FBI doesn\u2019t break down the Hispanic murderers by race, but even if we assume all Hispanic murderers were white, about 23 percent of murderers were non-Hispanic whites. We don\u2019t know the race of all murderers, but even if one assumes that all murderers whose race isn\u2019t identified are minorities, about 31 percent of murderers were white.\n\nIf you were to xerox the description that Bloomberg gives, you are going to be falsely identifying a lot of minorities as criminals.\n\nBloomberg is no more accurate when it comes to the ages of murderers. It is true that young people were responsible for a disproportionate share of these crimes, but the numbers were nowhere close to what Bloomberg claims. Just over 28 percent of murderers were between 13 and 25 years of age. About 35 percent of 13 to 25-years-old murderers were white.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIt is too bad that Bloomberg has to tar the Stop and Frisk program with such over the top generalizations of who commits murder.\n\nWhat Bloomberg also misses out on is that while there are good reasons to disarm criminals, poor minorities, the very people who are most likely victims of violent crime, are the ones who benefit the most from carrying concealed handguns. Bloomberg\u2019s claim that you can just Xerox off a picture of young minority males and \u201cthrow them up against the walls\u201d doesn\u2019t distinguish between law-abiding blacks who want to protect themselves and the criminals.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt the time when this recording originally surfaced in 2015, the media focused on Bloomberg\u2019s opposition to marijuana legalization, not to his racial conversation. This could also be a liability among blacks, who are arrested for drug possession at much higher rates than other races.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s moves on criminal justice reform, coupled with historically low minority unemployment rates, are already threatening to make inroads on minority voting. A Bloomberg nomination might make these inroads even greater and set the stage for a resounding electoral victory by Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JOHN LOTT", "author": ["John Lott"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/W8NR6zU5Qwo/trump-balanced-budget-pro-worker-pro-family-pro-growth-jim-banks", "published": "2020-02-11T13:16:28", "title": "Rep.

One could presume they failed to \u201cshow\u201d their \u201cvalues\u201d because the values held by the radical leftwing of the Democrat Party today would terrify voters.\n\nIn contrast, President Trump is not afraid to put his cards on the table. Monday, he announced his 2021 presidential budget request (PBR), A Budget for America\u2019s Future. After reading through it, I can endorse it as pro-worker, pro-family and pro-growth.\n\nDAVID AVELLA: SANDERS VS. BLOOMBERG \u2014 DEMOCRATS' CHOICE IS A SOCIALIST WIN OR A BILLIONAIRE COUP\n\nLike the budget we produced at the Republican Study Committee, the president presents a path to balance the budget.\n\nThe president\u2019s budget would put the federal ledger in the black in just 15 years. It includes $4.6 trillion in deficit savings over the next 10 years.\n\nThis is major progress from the \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d Washington that has produced $23.2 trillion in national debt and faces annual $1 trillion deficits over the next decade. And it\u2019s definitely not a surprise from an administration that has recommended more budget cuts than any other administration in modern history.\n\nTo achieve fiscal responsibility, President Trump is recommending deep cuts to bloated bureaucracies in D.C. and discontinuing programs that are no longer needed or should be handled by state governments.\n\nOf those included cuts is a 26 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency, which is music to Hoosier farmers\u2019 ears.\n\nThe budget also encourages reforms to eliminate the infamous year-end spending sprees. Federal agencies often empty their accounts at the end of the fiscal year to justify getting the same dollar amount in next year\u2019s budget.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe PBR also addresses the money the federal government pays to dead people. Openthebooks.com found there are six million active Social Security numbers that belong to people aged 112 and older, which is 5,999,960 more than the 40 people who are actually aged 112 (and over) and alive today.\n\nThe president\u2019s budget addresses this issue by introducing new strategies to reduce monetary loss, reasoning that \u201cprotecting taxpayer money and making sure it is serving its intended purpose is a fundamental responsibility.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the president\u2019s budget provides a blueprint for additional oversight to ensure the federal government learns the \u201cArt of the Deal,\u201d by negotiating better contracts with private contractors.\n\nBut it does not cut vital programs. For example, the president\u2019s budget keeps much-needed defense spending, keeping his promise to continue rebuilding the military and it even proposes funding for 1,000 miles of the border wall.\n\nIt also proposes a big jump in funding for artificial intelligence and quantum information sciences --- both vital to our global power competition with China.\n\nFinally, it promotes a 13 percent funding boost for our veterans, ensuring our nation\u2019s finest get the care they deserve.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn page 16 of the chapter on stopping wasteful and unnecessary spending, there is a section that summarizes the philosophy undergirding the president\u2019s budget: \u201cThis agenda is focused on new strategies to reduce monetary loss because protecting taxpayer money and making sure it is serving its intended purpose is a fundamental responsibility.\u201d I could not agree more.\n\nThe president has set down his marker for his stance on fiscal responsibility. This is a quantum leap in the right direction. And better yet\u2014it\u2019s a far cry from the radical proposals made by left-wing Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP. JIM BANKS", "author": ["Rep.

Whether it is after a bad break-up, a divorce, a death, or even as a teenager dreaming of a first love, we\u2019ve all wondered, is there such a thing as \u201cthe one.\u201d\n\nOr, for those of you that are like me and fall in love with every second person they have a crush on, many \u201cthe ones\u201d? Given that in the United States half of first marriages, two-thirds of second marriages and three-quarters of third marriages fail, everyone better hope that there isn\u2019t only one of \u201cthe one.\u201d\n\nJIM DALY: VALENTINE'S DAY -- WHAT DADS WANT\n\n\n\nNow, there are many psychologists and advice-givers that will talk about a first fairy tale love, a second hard love, and the final easy third love, but none of them show any real statistical evidence so let\u2019s take a deeper dive and see if we can find any real statistics behind the answer to this question.\n\n\n\nA mathematician, Dr. Hannah Fry, wrote a book on patterns in sex, love, and marriage, which showcased a fascinating theory. Fish tend to reject the first 37 percent of possible partners no matter what, and then the first possible partner that comes along, who is better than all those that the fish rejected, is the partner the fish chooses. Fry relates that to patterns we see in human nature, namely, we play the field into our late 20\u2019s and then we choose a partner and settle down.\n\nSo, for example, if you believe you are most likely going to have 10 love partners in your future, you should reject the first 4, and marry the next love partner that comes along who is better than the first four. Or if you believe you are going to have 20 love partners, you should reject the first 8 and marry the ninth person.\n\nAs Fry so aptly puts, it is a fine balance between having the patience to wait for the right person and the foresight to cash in before all the good ones are taken. -- This means that at some point, we just make the choice to fall in love and settle down.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, I had a high school sweetheart, then fell in love with a nerdy math guy in college, had a long wonderful relationship with a kilt-wearing Scotsman in Glasgow and am now back in the US. This means the guy I\u2019m dating should be super worried because statistically speaking I should choose to fall in love immediately and settle down (hope you aren\u2019t reading this).\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\n\nInterestingly, we all do this very naturally \u2013 human nature tends to follow patterns. So where does that leave us?\n\n\n\nOn average, in the US, people will have about 11 sexual partners. Now, one can imagine that if you are in love with someone, you most likely will sleep with that individual. This means that the absolute maximum amount of times you can fall in love in your lifetime is 11 i.e. a cap of 11. But we need to remove one-night stands, which Americans have, on average, twice in their lifetime, bringing the maximum amount of times you can fall in love down to 9.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\n\nBut, if we reject the first 3 of our sexual/love partners and marry the 4th, that would leave us with 5 other future possible partners meaning that we have a maximum of 6 times that we will fall in love.\n\n\n\nNow these are numbers are very subjective and pretty much a complete (albeit educated) guess. Human emotions are messy, complicated and usually completely irrational, which is the antithesis of statistics. But what these numbers do show us is that there are patterns, there are inferences we can make from the past about the future, and it can give you hope that there is no such thing as \u201cthe one and only.\u201d Your next great love might just be around the corner.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIBERTY VITTERT", "author": ["Liberty Vittert", "Liberty Vittert Is A Professor Of The Practice Of Data Science At The Olin Business School At Washington University In St. Louis", "An Ambassador For The Royal Statistical Society.

Palestinian leaders refused to even consider it, preferring to whip their people into yet another self-destructive day of rage.\n\nOn Tuesday Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and disgraced former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert are expected to address the United Nations and reject the American plan, perhaps even offering plans of their own. But time and circumstances in the region have moved on, even if these two men have not.\n\nBefore joining the Trump Administration, I finished up the oral history project I had been working on for years with Henry Kissinger. During our interviews, Kissinger said the reason the Nixon Administration didn\u2019t engage in the Middle East during their first term was that neither the Arabs nor Israelis were ready to negotiate. The Arabs had been soundly defeated in the 1967 war and lost important territory to Israel, even though the Arabs had begun hostilities. No Arab leader would contemplate negotiating after being so thoroughly humiliated.\n\nJARED KUSHNER SAYS PALESTINIANS LOST CREDIBILITY BY REJECTING WH MIDEAST PEACE PLAN\n\nThe Israelis weren\u2019t ready for peace either because they saw no reason to give up territory they had just won.\n\nFurthermore, there were no great powers pushing them to the negotiating table. The Arab states were aligned with the Soviet Union, as Israel was with the United States. The preconditions necessary for diplomacy weren\u2019t there.\n\nThe 1973 Arab-Israeli war changed everything. The Arab nations got back their self-respect when they took back some of the lands they had lost in 1967. Although once again victorious, the Israelis got a bloody nose and realized they were not invincible. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat turned to the U.S. to help negotiate a ceasefire with Israel.\n\nKissinger set off on weeks of Middle East shuttle diplomacy, which ultimately resulted in separate bilateral disengagement agreements between Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Israel. The U.S. supported the Arab nations with considerable aid and became the dominant power in the region, replacing the Soviet Union. Five years later President Jimmy Carter brokered a formal peace treaty between Israel and Egypt with the Camp David Accords.\n\nMeanwhile, the Palestinian problem festered. In the years that followed the Sunni Gulf Arab nations, as well as the mullahs in Iran, encouraged Palestinian resentment and supported anti-Israeli radical terrorist movements. The closest the Palestinians and Israelis came to any kind of peace was when President Bill Clinton tried to bring the two sides together in the closing months of his administration. In the end, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat refused to sign the agreement.\n\nOne of Arafat\u2019s young aides during this period was Bashar Masri. Today Masri is one of the most successful businessmen in the West Bank, and creator of the visionary Palestinian city Rawabi. But in the late 1980s, Masri helped lead the first Palestinian intifada against Israel. He was an idealistic young aide to Arafat when he signed the Oslo accords in 1993, which laid the groundwork for a two-state solution.\n\nYears ago, I asked Masri why Arafat refused to sign an agreement which gave him almost all of what he wanted and would have fulfilled his dream of a Palestinian nation. Masri shrugged and said that Arafat had spent his whole life fighting Israel and just couldn\u2019t bring himself to accept peace, even though he knew it was likely to be the best deal they could have gotten.\n\nTo get a diplomatic breakthrough you need two things -- a fundamental change in the situation and leaders willing to take the risk and leap into the unknown.\n\nThe first condition is now being met, with the geopolitical realignment in the region. The Trump Administration, under Jared Kushner\u2019s leadership, has forged a closer relationship between the United States and Sunni Gulf Arabs, led by Saudi Arabia. At the same time, they have fostered a closer connection between those countries and Israel. Today all three -- the Israelis, Sunni Arabs and the U.S. -- are united in their belief that Iran presents the greatest threat to peace and prosperity in the region.\n\nSecondly, the Trump Administration has crippled Iran economically and isolated it politically. By pulling out of the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, imposing crippling sanctions on Iran and shutting off their oil exports, President Trump has brought the Iranian economy to its knees. Iran has been forced to cut back on its support for its terrorist proxies throughout the region, especially the Palestinian groups in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nFinally, by killing terrorist mastermind General Soleimani, the Trump Administration has thrown Iran\u2019s proxy armies into chaos.\n\nThese factors combine to create a new reality for the Palestinians. Their terrorist groups face dwindling funds and support from their main sponsor, Iran. Their leaders are old, tired and short on new ideas. Their options are rapidly narrowing, their outside support evaporating and their leverage waning. Time is not on their side and the longer they wait to make peace with Israel the less likely they are to meet their objectives.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe thing I find intriguing about the American plan is that it puts the pressures on the Israelis and Palestinians from the outside in. Kushner, a businessman himself, understands that the key to making any progress in the Middle East isn\u2019t by starting with the politicians who have a vested interest in keeping the enmity going. It\u2019s by getting investors, entrepreneurs and businessmen, who see the practical advantages of working across sectarian lines, to lead the way.\n\nKushner\u2019s approach resonates with something I learned a decade ago when I was in Israel. I was taping two segments for my FoxNews.com show, \u201cDEFCON3.\u201d The first was a panel discussion with Israeli and Palestinian politicians, the second with Israeli and Palestinian businessmen. While I was in the studio interviewing the politicians -- who each recited their standard litany of grievances against the other -- guests for the second panel were sitting in the green room. My husband was there, too, and said they were having a far more interesting conversation than mine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Israeli and Palestinian businessmen, who all knew of each other, had never actually met. After introducing themselves, they started talking about business possibilities. They discussed that if their two countries were allowed to trade, the Palestinian companies could be the portal for Israeli goods to be exported throughout the Arab world. The Palestinian agri-businessman asked the Israelis about selling heirloom tomatoes and other produce in the West Bank to high-end Tel Aviv and European restaurants. The Israeli businessman discussed supplying materials to the Palestinian real estate developer. While the politicians were dug into their same old ruts the entrepreneurial businessmen were trying to figure out how to make money with each other.\n\nWhat the Palestinians need now is a new generation of leaders, not from the political world who thrive on enmity, but from their business community who know that only with peace can they and their people prosper. The Trump plan gives them a starting point; it\u2019s up to them to take it from there.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY KT MCFARLAND", "author": ["K.T.

This is not heavy lifting for Joe Biden.\n\nChris Matthews, MSNBC host: I thought that message today was very, very thrilling to me. I thought it was very American. I thought it was great.\n\nMan, we're glad we saved the tape. They wish we hadn't. Biden is going to win! He's got cool sunglasses -- aviators -- just like Steve McQueen. He's on fire, en fuego! Everyone else is at the kiddie table. Biden has got this in the bag. That was their view.\n\nAnd then Biden started running, which meant talking.

And still, the prognosticators assured us that Joe Biden was the inevitable winner. He had to be.\n\nOh, but the South Carolina primary is coming up. Biden has got a lock on African-Americans, they told us. Black people love him.\n\nWhatever you say cable news geniuses.\n\nWe just got the new Quinnipiac poll. It shows Biden dropping 22 points among black voters in just two weeks. Mike Bloomberg, meanwhile -- Mr. Stop and Frisk -- he is up 15 points among those same voters.\n\nWhat does it prove? It proves that in politics, as in life, you never really know. Better to be honest about that. But of course, they never are.\n\nKeep in mind, these people, the ones you just saw get huge salaries to do what? To predict the future. Yet, they're virtually always wrong. Frustrating? Yes. It's frustrating. We still remember when they were telling us to buy condos in Vegas a week before the 2008 real estate collapse.\n\nOn the other hand, their consistent idiocy -- and it is consistent -- does create a potentially lucrative investment opportunity for the rest of us.\n\nStop Bernie. That is the focus right now and in Democratic circles in Washington, that's really all they're thinking about. They fear Bernie more than Trump.\n\nEvery time someone on one of these MSNBC panels -- you know, The Washington Post editorial writer seated next to the retired CIA analyst across from the former federal prosecutor and the fake Democratic strategist who has never run a campaign -- that group -- every time that group agrees that something momentous is just about to happen, bet against it. And go all in when you do. Take a mortgage out on the house again. Get a loan from your brother-in-law in Boca Raton. Collect the dimes from under your couch and send it all to your broker. Go long against the consensus on cable news and you will get rich.\n\nWe don't know what the future holds, obviously, but we can be certain of at least one thing in the world: When everyone in Washington says it's true, it's not true. The opposite usually is true.\n\nApparently, Joe Biden hasn't quite figured this out yet, which is why he is still running. As of this hour, he is still making candidate-like noises out there on the campaign trail, by turns, charming and baffling the shrinking number of New Hampshire voters who come out to see him.\n\nHere's his latest exchange.\n\nBiden: That's a good question. Number one: Iowa is a Democratic caucus -- you have ever been to a caucus? No, you haven't. You're a lying dog-faced pony soldier. You said you were, but now, you've got to be honest. I'm going to be honest with you.\n\nTake that, you lying dog-faced pony soldier! It's going to be hard not to miss Joe Biden when he drops out.\n\nIn the meantime, here's a line he can use the next time some voter dares to ask him why he is losing.\n\nSteve Martin from 1986's \"Three Amigos\": There you slime eating dog. You scumsucking pig. You sons of a motherless goat.\n\nYou could just hear Biden saying that. Hopefully, he will get to that in South Carolina and Nevada.\n\nLet's hope though, in the end, his political obituaries aren't too mean to Joe Biden. It's not really fair to blame him for this mess. Shallow people with rapidly declining faculties shouldn't be running for president in the first place.\n\nSoon, probably very soon, Biden will be safely in Florida wearing white knee socks and enjoying the 4:30 prime rib special. He'll be a lot happier then. But the people who encouraged him to run, despite the evidence and predicted his victory, we should remember their names. They've got no excuse. They're not senile. They're just stupid.\n\nTo be fair, though, there are still some voters out there who sincerely believe Joe Biden can win it all and somehow their enthusiasm seems even more hurtful than the attacks of his enemies. In the latest spasm of Biden support from New Hampshire, supporters could be heard singing \"Biden's back, all right!\"\n\nLet's be honest, the Democratic contest, as of now, is now between Mike Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders. That's a disaster for Democrats. The party can either nominate Bernie and go full socialist, or steal the nomination from Bernie and face some sort of real cataclysm at the convention in Milwaukee and beyond Milwaukee.\n\n\"Biden's back, all right.\" Ever seen anything sadder than that? Not since the last Peaches and Herb reunion tour played the Wichita County Fair. Time is the cruelest critic of all. Biden himself seemed uncertain of what to make of all the praise. He had that vacant, slightly confused look like he had just been told to blow out the candles on his 90th birthday cake.\n\nNone of this amuses Democratic officials in Washington. They know their party is in danger of not having a nominee at all by the time that convention arrives.\n\nHere's the difference. Most Republican primaries award all or most all delegates to the winner of the state, but not so on the Democratic side. Thanks to changes that Bernie Sanders demanded after the last election, many delegates are distributed on a proportional basis on the Democratic side. And that means if there are three or more viable candidates in the race after Super Tuesday, there will almost certainly be a brokered convention -- and a bitter one.\n\nThat is very bad news for Democrats. The people who thought they ran the Democratic Party here in Washington are starting to figure that out, and they're upset.\n\nJames Carville, veteran political strategist: There is a certain part of the Democratic Party that wants us to be a cult. I'm not interested in being in a cult. Some people in this country want a revolution, they want disruption. You know, I don't know what -- they scream at people. They go and bully people. And I don't know how you want to lecture them -- 78 years old standing up screaming at the microphone about the revolution. But you've got to give people an alternative.\n\nYes, so, at the end, you heard what it's really about. Their main fear is Bernie Sanders.\n\nNow rich liberals will put up with almost any amount of social engineering, in case you haven't noticed -- non-binary bathrooms, check; woke self- abasement, fine. But they tend to be completely humorless on the subject of money, especially when it means handing over some of their money to the people below them. They're not into it. At all.\n\nThey get hysterical, and they start ranting about public executions.\n\nChris Matthews: I have my own views of the word \"socialist,\" and I'll be glad to tell them -- share them with you in private, and they go back to the early 1950s.\n\nI have an attitude about them. I remember the Cold War. I have an attitude towards Castro. I believe that Castro and the Reds had won the Cold War, there would be executions in Central Park and I might have been one of the ones getting executed. And certain other people would be there cheering, okay, so I have a problem with people who took the other side.\n\nI don't know who Bernie supports over these years. I don't know what he means by socialism. One week it's Denmark? We're going to be like Denmark. OK, that's harmless. That is basically a capitalist country with a lot of good social welfare programs. Denmark is harmless.\n\nChris Hayes, MSNBC host: He's pretty clearly in the Denmark category, yes.\n\nMatthews: Is he?\n\nHayes: Yes.\n\nMatthews: Are you sure? How do you know? Did he tell you that?\n\nStop Bernie. That is the focus right now and in Democratic circles in Washington, that's really all they're thinking about.\n\nThey fear Bernie more than Trump. But the question is, how do they stop him? It is still a democracy after all.\n\nProbably not with Amy Klobuchar. So that leaves two former mayors to get the job done, one from of a mid-sized Midwestern town, the other of America's largest city.\n\nNow, a lot of donors in New York and Los Angeles would rather go with the former, Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend. For one thing, he was never a Republican, unlike Mike Bloomberg.\n\nBut there are questions about Pete Buttigieg. The main one is not can he become president? The main one is, is he actually human? Does he leave footprints? Has he ever cast a shadow? Or is this so-called Pete Buttigieg exactly what he appears to be --a corporate hologram designed by the HR Department at Google for instructional purposes?\n\nWell, who knows? But it's possible that AI is now so sophisticated that we're looking at our first robotic presidential candidate.\n\nYou'll notice, for example -- not to be a conspiracy nut, but it's true -- every word Buttigieg utters is perfectly synchronized with the official view from Silicon Valley and the finance world.\n\nNow, what are the chances of that occurring in nature? This may be the new frontier in automation, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nThe other candidates clearly don't know what to make of the whole thing. Biden took the first swing at Buttigieg in a nasty new television ad. When Joe Biden calls you unaccomplished, it stings.\n\nVoiceover in Biden ad: When President Obama called on, Joe Biden helped lead the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which gave health care to 20 million people.\n\nAnd when park-goers called on Pete Buttigieg, he installed decorative lights under bridges, giving citizens of South Bend colorfully illuminated rivers.\n\nUnder threat of a nuclear Iran, Joe Biden helped to negotiate the Iran Deal.\n\nAnd under threat of disappearing pets, Buttigieg negotiated lighter licensing regulations on pet chip scanners.\n\nOK, Joe Biden, but can we be honest for one moment? Which would you actually rather have? An Iran deal or a chip scanner that helps find your lost dog? I mean, really.\n\nIt is an interesting question anyway. Biden left it unanswered.\n\nNevertheless, at Friday's debate, the other candidates followed his lead and pushed a similar theme.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn: We have a newcomer in the White House and look where it got us. I think having some experience is a good thing.\n\nTom Steyer: We need people with experience. That's why I'm worried about Mayor Pete. You need to be able to go toe to toe with this guy and take him down on the debate stage or we're going to lose.\n\nSen Bernie Sanders: Unlike some of the folks up here, I don't have 40 billionaires, Pete, contributing to my campaign coming from the pharmaceutical industry, coming from Wall Street.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: I don't think any billionaire ought to be able to do it, and I don't think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns ought to do it.\n\nSays the lady who just got off a private plane the other day.\n\nThe whole thing seems a little unfair if you think about it for a minute. There was Tom Steyer, who is currently suffering through one of the worst midlife crises in recorded history. He has never been elected to anything -- and never will be. He was attacking Pete Buttigieg for not being accomplished enough? Irony is definitely dead.\n\nOn the other hand, so is Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign, no matter what they're claiming on television. Buttigieg is too fake. He's too unnervingly programmed. He's not going to win.\n\nAnd anyway, if you're looking for a tiny, finance-friendly, former mayor, we've already got one for you, who by the way, has tens of billions of dollars to spend on the race. Let's be honest, the Democratic contest, as of now, is now between Mike Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders.\n\nThat's a disaster for Democrats. The party can either nominate Bernie and go full socialist or steal the nomination from Bernie and face some sort of real cataclysm at the convention in Milwaukee and beyond Milwaukee.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThose are the options.

It is more likely, however, that it will do no more than throw fuel on the growing fire of the Democrats' burgeoning political civil war and, while Sen Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg will garner headlines, the real importance of New Hampshire could be the fate of Sen Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn modern politics, the barrier to entering the race to become president has become quite low. Hence, more than two dozen Democrats joined the race. That wide, 2020 field of Democrats means a broad spectrum of candidates has now winnowed into two broad camps: the far-left Sanders/Warren camp and all of the others said to be \u201cmoderate\u201d by comparison to Sanders and Warren.\n\nAccording to the Iowa results, the Sanders/Warren faction garners the support of roughly 44 percent of the Democratic voters. The latest New Hampshire polling places that uneasy alliance at between 40 and 42 percent. In the all-important state of California, with its 495 delegates, that number is between 44 and 46 percent as well.\n\nSANDERS IN LEAD, BUTTIGIEG SLIPPING, KLOBUCHAR SURGING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL ON PRIMARY EVE\n\nThe most likely outcome of the New Hampshire primary that matters is not just that Sanders will likely win and that Buttigieg will come in second. If Bernie wins and Iowa is decided in his favor after a potential recanvass, keep in mind, Ed Muskie is the only Democratic candidate to win both Iowa and New Hampshire and then be denied the nomination.\n\nBeyond Bernie\u2019s consecutive victories, what will matter most is that the Sanders/Warren wing of the party will continue to garner such a large block of the voters. That block of voters is more energized and committed than the so-called moderate block.\n\nAfter New Hampshire, the person to watch could well be Warren, not Sanders. If Sanders continues to finish higher than Warren, it is quite likely that Warren\u2019s support will begin to move from her camp to Sanders'. That promises to hand Sanders more victories on Super Tuesday, including in all-important California. Sanders is in the lead in California and has the best operation there by far in part because that operation still exists from his run in 2016 -- a dynamic that helps him all over the country.\n\nBeyond that, California has moved farther left along with Sanders and every victory he gets only brings him reinforcements, not to mention money. Sanders raised a staggering $25 million in January alone. In short, one result of New Hampshire will be Sanders gaining momentum, which causes great fear from the likes of James Carville to Chris Mathews to moderate Democrats everywhere.\n\nAs for that so-called moderate camp, New Hampshire will reaffirm once more that Biden has never won a primary or caucus. As I wrote last April, Biden has often looked good on paper as a candidate but has never performed well as a presidential candidate in the past -- and he is not now.\n\nAt best, Biden will finish 3rd or 4th in New Hampshire and his fundraising will take a further hit. That result likely will mean that Biden\u2019s so-called electability moniker will be finished once and for all. After all, you cannot be electable if you cannot win the nomination.\n\nWhile Biden likely won\u2019t drop out right away, Buttigieg\u2019s expected strong finish in New Hampshire will reinforce the split among the so-called moderates. After New Hampshire, Buttigieg, Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will fight for the non-Sanders mantle with Tom Steyer siphoning off votes to varying degrees depending on the state.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAmong those three, Buttigieg, Biden and Bloomberg, the first to drop out will likely be Biden as his fundraising fortunes lag. Meanwhile, Buttigieg will have received another bump. Even so, questions for Buttigieg will remain. Biden was right to bring up Buttigieg's weakness with minority voters. After New Hampshire, the question will be whether Buttigieg can place well or win in other states.\n\nOne important likely result of New Hampshire will be that the leader of the so-called moderate Democratic faction won\u2019t be settled any time soon. Further, with more candidates vying for that mantle than the socialist wing mantle, simple mathematics tells you that the moderate wing candidates will split that delegate pool so much that no one of those candidates will have as many delegates as Sanders by the end of Super Tuesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs for the remaining Democrat candidates, Sen Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, Steyer and Andrew Yang, some will likely soldier on through Super Tuesday. Steyer and Yang because they have the money and Klobuchar because she is the Democrats' best vice presidential candidate.\n\nAfter New Hampshire and until their July convention the most visible aspect of the Democrats' nomination process may well be their internal and messy fight to stop Bernie Sanders -- not their effort to defeat President Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY TOM DEL BECCARO", "author": ["Tom Del Beccaro"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/HvOFZXcT87I/democrats-brokered-convention-2020-newt-gingrich", "published": "2020-02-10T20:46:19", "title": "Newt Gingrich: Democrats, get ready for a brokered convention", "text": "Because of the stunning incompetence of the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s mismanagement of the caucuses, we still don\u2019t have uncontested results one week after the event.

Biden is going to have an extraordinarily difficult time raising money going forward. He has run a tremendously expensive campaign and burned through a lot of funds.\n\nFurthermore, he has tended to raise his money from large donors, so many have already given him the legal maximum.\n\nBy contrast, Sanders has the largest number of small donors and can go back to them month-after-month for $10 and $20 donations. These add up into millions.\n\nIt is hard to imagine Biden competing on Super Tuesday in expensive states like California and Texas because he simply won\u2019t be able to buy statewide ads.\n\nIronically, the possibility that Biden is on the edge of dropping out the race will not narrow the field. This is because former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg is coming into the race just when his money can start making a real difference. Unlike Biden, Bloomberg can afford to compete everywhere and simply drown his opponents in ads.\n\nNo one in politics should underestimate Bloomberg\u2019s understanding of public opinion and his willingness to use the best experts that money can attract.\n\nIn fact, Bloomberg announced last week that (in light of the Iowa Caucus results) he is going to double the amount of money he is spending. He will certainly start picking up support just from the sheer weight and quality of his advertising.\n\nNo one in politics should underestimate Bloomberg\u2019s understanding of public opinion and his willingness to use the best experts that money can attract.\n\nBloomberg made part of his billions out of Bloomberg News. He won the mayoral race in New York City three times (the last time spending an estimated $200 per vote). He has more than $60 billion in net worth. This means he could spend $2 billion or $3 billion on a presidential campaign and not even notice it.\n\nHowever, even with all his money, it is unlikely that Bloomberg will sweep the delegates.\n\nThe Republicans have a series of winner take all primaries after a certain point. However, the Democrats have a proportional representation beginning at 15 percent. This means that every candidate who can get 15 percent or more of the vote will have an incentive to stay in the race.\n\nFurthermore, Bloomberg has some weaknesses that will be hard to overcome in a Democratic primary.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nHis stop and frisk policing policy as mayor of New York was seen as racist and was deeply resented. Large parts of the Black community may go to Warren or Sanders rather than Bloomberg (Buttigieg seems to have a similar problem and gets little support from African-Americans).\n\nBloomberg was a registered Republican when he ran the first time for mayor and later ran as an independent. Yet, he tends to dictate what people can do (he outlawed Big Gulp cups in New York when he was mayor). He has been so aggressively anti-gun that in some areas there will be moderate Democrats deeply opposed to him.\n\nFinally, Bloomberg carries the burden of being a big billionaire. He is so wealthy he is almost a model for the kind of rich person Senators Sanders and Warren deeply dislike.\n\nFor the increasingly radical Democratic Party to nominate a former Republican billionaire purely because he is willing to spend what it takes to buy the nomination would probably lead to a massive revolt at their convention in Milwaukee this summer.\n\nIt is a little hard to imagine Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Squad passively accepting Bloomberg as their standard-bearer.\n\nIf everyone who can get 15 percent (and therefore some delegates) stays in the race \u2013 and if an assault on Bloomberg keeps him from breaking 50 percent \u2013 then it is entirely possible the Democrats are headed toward a wide-open convention.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis means the super delegates (who are incumbents and officials with no real legitimacy except their titles) could come into play on the second ballot.\n\nBuckle your political seat belt, America, the Democratic race could become incredibly turbulent.\n\nTo read, hear, and watch more of Newt\u2019s commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH", "author": ["Newt Gingrich", "Former Speaker Of The U.S. House Of Representatives Newt Gingrich Is The Host Of The"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/RkrVYNw3WLU/miranda-devine-petulant-nancy-pelosi-is-everything-wrong-with-democratic-party", "published": "2020-02-10T19:30:21", "title": "Miranda Devine: Petulant Nancy Pelosi is everything wrong with the Democratic Party", "text": "Nancy Pelosi looked like a malfunctioning Stepford wife as she sat behind President Trump during his State of the Union address last week.

So for me, success looks like someone getting the right internship, someone getting the right job. An entrepreneur getting the right advice. And then next year at All-Star Weekend, can we keep all of these people and ideas aligned? Can we keep those messages and narratives aligned throughout the year? We want to ultimately create disruption and get results. We had a women's tech summit in L.A. that resulted in a new foundation for women in the business of sports, and so we're setting up a system to track our members' and ambassadors' ideas that come out of these events.\n\nRelated: Chris Paul: 'I Had $151 in My Bank Account When I Declared for the NBA'\n\nAnd, for me personally, the panels are a great opportunity to be a fan. we have people who are extremely knowledgeable in their subject matter, and I can sit there and listen.

But as we all know, as your business grows, you can\u2019t (nor should you) do everything yourself. At some point, you have to learn how to delegate.\n\nThe good news is that delegating is not rocket science. By focusing on the fundamentals, you can learn to delegate effectively and reclaim your time.\n\nKnowing what should (and shouldn\u2019t) be delegated\n\nThe most important aspect of delegating with confidence is prioritizing tasks and figuring out what needs to be handed off.\n\nRelated: How to Delegate Better and Become a Great Leader\n\nHere are the questions you need to ask yourself to figure out whether a task should be delegated:\n\nDoes it need to be done? If it doesn\u2019t actually need to be done, the worst possible thing you can do is delegate it. This would be a waste of time and money. As Peter Drucker once said, \u201cThere is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.\u201d Is it a recurring task? If a task is going to repeat, then look for ways to partially or fully automate it. Can someone else do it? If yes, then it should absolutely be delegated. This will free up your time to focus on your highest-value activities. Are you actually the best person to do the job? If yes, then do it yourself, keeping in mind the answer to this question is likely to change over time.\n\nThe delegation triangle\n\nOnce you\u2019ve established that delegation is the best course of action and what tasks need to be delegated, you\u2019re ready to develop a solid delegation process.\n\nThink of delegation as a triangle, with the three points being who, what, and when. The delegation triangle can keep you on track and make delegating tasks easier.\n\nRelated: Learn When to Delegate and When to Micromanage\n\nWho: You need to get very clear about who is accountable for completing a task. Don\u2019t just say, \u201cHey, I need help getting this done.\u201d\n\nDesignate a single point of accountability for each task. The last thing you want is for your team to be unclear on who needs to do what tasks.\n\nWhat: Paint a clear picture of the outcome you want. Make sure this is every bit as clear to the other person as it is to you, so you don\u2019t have to go back and rework anything.\n\nWhen: Set clear and realistic deadlines so everyone is on the same page.

Devices mediate vital communications. Scheduling programs help organize busy lives. Data infrastructures make it possible to collect, secure, analyze and transmit information as it happens in real-time. Managing employees is much easier with project management software.\n\nBut when your technology isn\u2019t productive, it kills your productivity, too.\n\nMaking some simple tweaks can help you optimize your performance \u2014 and that of your entire company.

Are you spending as much repairing your old devices as you would by replacing them?\n\nRelated: 9 Productivity Mistakes You're Making in the First 10 Minutes of Your Day\n\nNo matter how cutting-edge your technology once was, its functionality will wane over time. The average office computer provides three to five years of service before retirement. Smartphones and tablets often don\u2019t make it to their two-year anniversaries. Depending on the needs of your business, that lifespan could be even shorter.\n\nNow\u2019s a good time to take an honest appraisal of your technology\u2019s performance. Try giving equipment that\u2019s not working efficiently a tune-up. If that doesn\u2019t suffice, it may be time to replace it.\n\nRelated: Upgrading Your IT Equipment\n\nThe expense involved sometimes deters entrepreneurs from investing in needed upgrades, but it shouldn\u2019t.

You\u2019ll have extra cash to buy the new tech that will help your business run smoother. Making a bulk purchase with the same vendor could get you a discounted rate.\n\n2. Too much communication kills productivity\n\nCommunication keeps a business running. But too much communication over too many channels kills productivity.\n\nEvery day, communications inundate entrepreneurs on the go. Phone calls from clients come in. Text messages buzz in with urgency. A traffic jam of unread emails is always waiting for a reply. There are meetings and hangouts on the schedule. Even apps like Slack, which was designed to simplify office communication, are becoming one more distraction from getting work done.\n\nRelated: 22 Power Routines That Will Boost Your Productivity\n\nWhat entrepreneurs need is a communications strategy that leverages the distinct advantages of each channel without overwhelming users.\n\nDon\u2019t jump on GoogleHangouts without an agenda for the conversation.

In most cases, the texts, calls and emails can wait.\n\n3. Fortify your security\n\nNothing destroys your productivity quite like a data compromise. In 2017, breaches set individual businesses back $7 million, on average. What\u2019s not included in that tally is the toll being hacked takes on organizations. Also missing from this calculation is the time it takes to fix things \u2014 and the lost productivity from making amends.\n\nThose dangers should be enough incentive for any entrepreneur to take some basic steps toward securing their information.\n\nRelated: 5 Daily Habits That Will Increase Your Productivity Levels\n\nProtecting your business can start with some very basic, but important, measures. Start by keeping up with software updates because these include patches to protect your network from bugs and hacks. Make sure you\u2019re using an effective antivirus program. Back up your data right now, and stay on a regular schedule of doing so in case of loss. Begin making plans to educate yourself and your staff on cybersecurity. There are some investments that entrepreneurs regret; security is never one of them.\n\nRelated: 9 Steps to Better Security\n\n4. Automate repetitive actions\n\nA McKinsey study found the average American worker spent 28% of his day answering emails, 19% collecting data and another 14% communicating with co-workers. That left only two out of every five hours of work on role-specific activity \u2014 what they were hired to do.\n\nIf teams could get rid of some of the more repetitive tasks, they could focus on more mission-critical work. That would supercharge productivity. Good news: A wave of automation is making it easier to get rid of those chores. Start with these quick fixes.\n\nEmails: Feel like you\u2019re sending the same emails all the time? Try using automation software like Zapier, which allows you to choreograph responses triggered by frequently asked questions.\n\nAnalytics: Entrepreneurs spend a lot of time reporting to investors, stakeholders and workers. They have better things to do than spend time tracking down the latest data and compiling specialized presentations. GoogleStudio is a free reporting tool that integrates with your CRM and sends prescheduled updates, with the latest analytics, to your partners.\n\nAccounting and Payroll: Making sure bills and employees get paid can be a time suck, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Blackline is one of a host of companies drawing on the power of rules-based machine learning to eliminate tedious (and error-prone) budget reconciliation processes. On the payroll side, there are many platforms that make compensating your employees easy through the power of automation.\n\nRelated: Want to Save Your Business an Hour a Day?

They need to think huge \u2014 as big as those who, decades before them, looked up into the night sky, saw a distant moon and thought: We're going to walk on the moon, and we\u2019re going to do it soon.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the unthinkable achievement of landing on the moon that changed humankind. It was everything the 400,000 engineers and scientists who worked on the program developed on the way to Neil Armstrong taking his \"one small step.\" From inventions such as freeze-dried food to fireproofing materials, from cooling suits to integrated circuits, these 400,000 people changed the course of history.\n\nIt's the act that inspired the idea of \"moonshot thinking,\" by which people aim to achieve something previously believed to be impossible. It's about thinking big rather than focusing on incremental gains, since succeeding with a moonshot comes with a whole host of small gains \u2014 and a whole lot more.\n\nOne example of a moonshot in progress? In December 2016, Congress passed a cancer moonshot initiative, allocating $1.8 billion in funding toward curing cancer once and for all. Maybe cancer will be cured, but either way, the inventions that forward-thinking individuals develop along the way could transform a number of industries. Look at the University of Missouri as an example: On Oct. 22, 2019, the institution announced that thanks to this moonshot, they plan to take a $3.7 million federal grant and work towards producing a more effective immunotherapy treatment for cancer patients. It may not be the ultimate cure, but it's a step towards it, funded due to that moonshot.\n\nEmerging areas for entrepreneurial moonshots\n\nSlowing the aging process and extending life\n\nEvery day, there are advances in medical technology that could lead to humans aging better and smarter. Some recent breakthroughs include the work of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, which is experimenting with gut biomes in mice with aims to alter the current trajectory of aging. Work is also being done on the structure of plant telomerase RNA in a co-venture between Texas A&M and Arizona State University. According to the institutions, a \"key component of the telomerase enzyme in the plant kingdom provides an evolutionary bridge ... for understanding how humans keep their DNA safe and enable cells to divide indefinitely.\"\n\nEnding malnutrition through agriculture technology\n\nMalnutrition is an enduring problem today. Reportedly, nearly 795 million people in the world, one out of every nine, do not have enough food, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly 45 percent of deaths among children under five years of age are linked to malnutrition.\n\nIBM is attempting to roll out technology that could help, including IBM PAIRS Geoscope and IBM Food Trust and Blockchain. By connecting people/entities in the supply chain, this type of technology could maximize efficiency and minimize waste from farm to table.\n\nProviding energy for all\n\nIn 2019, an estimated 840 million people reportedly did not have access to electricity. By 2030, that number is expected to drop to 650 million. It may be progress, but in many ways, it's not enough. Today, nearly three billion people reportedly rely on wood, coal, charcoal or animal waste for energy.\n\nSome technology companies are looking to revolutionize the design of microgrids. By making the design faster and less expensive, rural areas and remote islands could eventually meet energy needs previously too expensive or too difficult to attain. If we can create energy to light Las Vegas every night in the middle of a desert, we should be able to find a way to create enough energy for people to survive.\n\nHow to create a culture of moonshots\n\nInstead of working in a silo, entrepreneurs must share their ideas about the world's enduring problems. There will never be one person or entity with all the answers, but by working together, we may be able to piece together viable solutions. One example happening today: MIT\u2019s Center for Collective Intelligence has opened up collaboration between the MIT Media Lab, the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and the MIT Sloan School of Management. The overall goal of the collaboration is to \"understand collective intelligence at a deep level [in order to] create and take advantage of the new possibilities it enables ... [leading] to both new scientific understanding in a variety of disciplines and practical advances in many areas of business and society.\u201d\n\nIf we kept this in mind as leaders and entrepreneurs, there may be no limit to the technological heights we could reach or the societal ills we could cure. In my view, one day, we could place all of our innovations, challenges and, yes, possible solutions into a centralized hub that could be accessed and leveraged like a collaborative local library, with a directory for each addition and the process for individuals to \u201ccheck out\u201d the ideas they need in order to further innovation in any sector.\n\nThe tech giants of today may have extremely large budgets and many great minds, but they don't have all the answers or all the talent. Do not limit yourself to what is possible; instead, find your moonshot. Every day, people have out-of-the-box ideas and others tell them that it can't be done. Instead of listening blindly, know that there's a chance you're onto something.\n\nThink about that original moonshot, which came to fruition in 1969. America didn't ask, \"Can we land on the moon?\" Instead, we asked, \"How do we do it?\" The people behind the innovation assumed leaving the ground beneath our feet and walking on the moon was possible. It was just a matter of figuring out how.", "author": ["Mark Minevich"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/SHmqKU-EGgs/345372", "published": "2020-02-11T18:30:00", "title": "The Best Entrepreneurs Know When to Lose Control", "text": "Looking to expand your business? Being more vulnerable might help.\n\nFebruary 11, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nEarly in my career, when I was working as a developer for a New York media company, I had a colleague who was constantly worried about getting canned. To be fair, these were turbulent times \u2014 turnover was high and company-wide restructuring was frequent \u2014 so his worries weren\u2019t entirely misplaced.\n\nStill, the way he coped was by spending all his energy completing every task flawlessly, consequential or not. He was so consumed with preventing anything bad from happening that he had no energy left for the reason he pursed that line of work in the first place: Following creative hunches and exploring ideas outside of the box.\n\nMy old colleague is hardly the first person to react to uncertainty this way. Many of us have a tendency to worry about the future, and as a result, we avoid allowing ourselves to be vulnerable. It makes sense: self-preservation is a natural instinct. That\u2019s why we buy home security systems and squirrel away money for rainy days.\n\nBut planning away negative outcomes is a fruitless endeavor. And it might even hurt our businesses.\n\nControl is an illusion\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why many couples choose to have destination weddings in the Caribbean: a beach sunset is a beautiful backdrop. But really, they\u2019re hedging their bets for great weather. Most of the time it works out, but sometimes the sky darkens and it rains on your wedding day.\n\nLike bad weather or in-laws getting along, there will always be things in life that we can\u2019t control.\n\nPain is part of the human experience, and it would be na\u00efve to think we can escape it. But that doesn\u2019t stop us from trying to put it off as long as possible. Somehow, that feels more comfortable than acknowledging the reality that life is messy and often unpredictable.\n\nThe same goes for running a business \u2014 especially in today\u2019s world, where digital platforms are the dominant business model and their trajectories are largely unpredictable. The idea that we could somehow ensure only positive outcomes is na\u00efve at best and damaging at worst.\n\nWriting for Forbes, Kumar Mehta, author of The Innovation Biome, explains:\n\n\u201cEven the most innovative companies fail more often than they succeed. Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft \u2014 companies widely regarded as the most innovative companies in the world \u2014 have had more failures than successes, more misses than hits. But the most innovative companies have a culture where they learn from failure, not just celebrate it.\u201d\n\nIf we focus entirely on trying to predict the future \u2014 working in a reactive mode \u2014 we might fail to keep up with the present. And the ability to relinquish some control means getting comfortable with vulnerability.\n\nWith vulnerability comes loyalty\n\nMerriam Webster defines vulnerable as \u201copen to attack or damage.\u201d On a personal level, that means letting down our guard and showing who we are, weaknesses and all. On an organizational level, vulnerability means accepting the possibility of failure \u2014 or, in other words, taking risks.\n\nTaking off your workplace armor can open you up to deeper connections with colleagues. Harvard Business Review shared a telling example of this kind of vulnerability. Years ago, Hubbl founder Archana Patchirajan called a staff meeting to announce that she had to let everyone go because her startup had run out of funds. Though they could have easily found work elsewhere, her employees refused to leave, offering instead to work for significantly less.\n\nThe story has a happy ending \u2014 Hubbl was acquired a few years later for $14 million. But the story's real lesson was why the staff chose to stay. HBR explained: \u201cArchana\u2019s relationship with her employees is deeper than that of the usual employer-employee relationship. Simply put, she is vulnerable and authentic with them.\u201d\n\nWhen we let our guard down, we can really let people in, and that\u2019s the most powerful way to inspire loyalty and engagement among colleagues. Work can be a cold place, so a little vulnerability can go a long way.\n\nVulnerability fosters risk-taking\n\nHigher levels of vulnerability \u2014 embracing risk and accepting the possibility of failure \u2014 sets the stage for creativity, something that the most innovative and prolific companies understand. Consider Coca Cola Co. In 1985, the beverage company release a reformulated version of its beloved soft drink, and was met with some serious backlash. Coca-Cola quickly switched back to its original formula, but the failure rippled through the company culture, ushering in a long period of cautiousness.\n\nBut recently, Coca-Cola's new CEO James Quincey has acknowledged that the company has fallen into a rut of complacency. He's urged managers to move beyond their fear of failure, saying, \u201cIf we\u2019re not making mistakes,\u201d he insisted, \u201cwe\u2019re not trying hard enough.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, whose business was built by leaning into risk, has commented:\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to take bold bets, they\u2019re going to be experiments. And if they\u2019re experiments, you don\u2019t know ahead of time if they\u2019re going to work. Experiments are by their very nature prone to failure. But a few big successes compensate for dozens and dozens of things that didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nSometimes it\u2019s impossible to predict how a product will be received. It was impossible to foresee that Google Glass would tank but Amazon\u2019s Alexa would become a household name, or to know whether longtime customers will enjoy your new beverage. One thing\u2019s for sure: You can\u2019t control a user\u2019s subjective experience. But you can commit to learning from flubs and focusing on factors within your command.\n\nFocusing on what we can control\n\nOf the myriad things that we cannot control, one thing that we can is our response in the face of negative outcomes. Not only does this approach allow us to let go and focus on the present, but it makes failures into teachable moments.\n\nAt my company JotForm, I encourage employees to take risks and investigate new ideas, no matter how seemingly far fetched. We even carve out dedicated time for that kind of exploration. The only caveat is that if and when we do make a mistake, we take a moment to step back and figure out the \u201cwhy.\u201d Maybe customers don\u2019t like a product update, or maybe they simply prefer a choice.\n\nAs long as we\u2019re reflecting, listening and pushing ourselves to new creative heights, it's all worth it.\n\nThere are many ways to encourage letting go, from establishing failure awards that celebrate projects that went awry, to openly disclosing your own missteps and what you learned from them. Once you create a culture that embraces failure, you might be surprised by how much your business grows.", "author": ["Aytekin Tank"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/Zh5RzPQlZxA/346212", "published": "2020-02-11T18:08:49", "title": "The Career Rise and Fall of Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes", "text": "She will stand trial over 'massive fraud' in July 2020.\n\nFebruary 11, 2020 12 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on Business Insider\n\n\n\nIn 2014, blood-testing startup Theranos and its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, were on top of the world.\n\nBack then, Theranos was a revolutionary idea thought up by a woman hailed as a genius who styled herself as a female Steve Jobs. Holmes was the world's youngest female self-made billionaire, and Theranos was one of Silicon Valley's unicorn startups, valued at an estimated $9 billion.\n\nBut then it all came crashing down.\n\nThe shortcomings and inaccuracies of Theranos's technology were exposed, along with the role Holmes played in covering it all up. Holmes was ousted as CEO and charged with \"massive fraud,\" and the company was forced to close its labs and testing centers, ultimately shuttering operations altogether.\n\nNow, Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. In the meantime, as she awaits trial, she's reportedly found the time to get engaged \u2014 and married \u2014 to a hotel heir named Billy Evans.\n\nThis is how Holmes went from precocious child, to ambitious Stanford dropout, to an embattled startup founder charged with fraud:\n\nElizabeth Holmes was born on February 3, 1984 in Washington, D.C. Her mom, Noel, was a Congressional committee staffer, and her dad, Christian Holmes, worked for Enron before moving to government agencies like USAID.\n\nHolmes' family moved when she was young, from Washington, D.C. to Houston.\n\nWhen she was 7, Holmes tried to invent her own time machine, filling up an entire notebook with detailed engineering drawings. At the age of 9, Holmes told relatives she wanted to be a billionaire when she grew up. Her relatives described her as saying it with the \"utmost seriousness and determination.\"\n\nHolmes had an \"intense competitive streak\" from a young age. She often played Monopoly with her younger brother and cousin, and she would insist on playing until the end, collecting the houses and hotels until she won. If Holmes was losing, she would often storm off. More than once, she ran directly through a screen on the door.\n\nIt was during high school that Holmes developed her work ethic, often staying up late to study. She quickly became a straight-A student, and even started her own business: she sold C++ compilers, a type of software that translates computer code, to Chinese schools.\n\nHolmes started taking Mandarin lessons, and part-way through high school, talked her way into being accepted by Stanford University\u2019s summer program, which culminated in a trip to Beijing.\n\nImage credit: Shutterstock\n\nInspired by her great-great-grandfather Christian Holmes, a surgeon, Holmes decided she wanted to go into medicine. But she discovered early on that she was terrified of needles. Later, she said this influenced her to start Theranos.\n\nHolmes went to Stanford to study chemical engineering. When she was a freshman, she became a \"president's scholar,\" an honor which came with a $3,000 stipend to go toward a research project.\n\nHolmes spent the summer after her freshman year interning at the Genome Institute in Singapore. She got the job partly because she spoke Mandarin.\n\nAs a sophomore, Holmes went to one of her professors, Channing Robertson, and said: \"Let's start a company.\" With his blessing, she founded Real-Time Cures, later changing the company's name to Theranos. Thanks to a typo, early employees\u2019 paychecks actually said \"Real-Time Curses.\"\n\nHolmes soon filed a patent application for \"Medical device for analyte monitoring and drug delivery,\" a wearable device that would administer medication, monitor patients' blood, and adjust the dosage as needed.\n\nBy the next semester, Holmes had dropped out of Stanford altogether, and was working on Theranos in the basement of a college house.\n\nImage credit: Jeff Chiu/AP\n\nTheranos's business model was based around the idea that it could run blood tests, using proprietary technology that required only a finger pinprick and a small amount of blood. Holmes said the tests would be able to detect medical conditions like cancer and high cholesterol.\n\nHolmes started raising money for Theranos from prominent investors like Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, the father of a childhood friend and the founder of prominent VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Theranos raised more than $700 million, and Draper has continued to defend Holmes.\n\nHolmes took investors' money on the condition that she wouldn't have to reveal how Theranos' technology worked. Plus, she would have final say over everything having to do with the company.\n\nThat obsession with secrecy extended to every aspect of Theranos. For the first decade Holmes spent building her company, Theranos operated in stealth mode. She even took three former Theranos employees to court, claiming they had misused Theranos trade secrets.\n\nHolmes' attitude toward secrecy and running a company was borrowed from a Silicon Valley hero of hers: former Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Holmes started dressing in black turtlenecks like Jobs, decorated her office with his favorite furniture, and like Jobs, never took vacations.\n\nImage credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nEven Holmes's uncharacteristically deep voice may have been part of a carefully crafted image intended to help her fit in in the male-dominated business world. In ABC's podcast on Holmes called \"The Dropout,\" former Theranos employees said the CEO sometimes \"fell out of character,\" particularly after drinking, and would speak in a higher voice.\n\nHolmes was a demanding boss, and wanted her employees to work as hard as she did. She had her assistants track when employees arrived and left each day. To encourage people to work longer hours, she started having dinner catered to the office around 8 p.m. each night.\n\nMore behind-the-scenes footage of what life was like at Theranos was revealed in leaked videos obtained by the team behind the HBO documentary \"The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley.\" The more than 100 hours of footage showed Holmes walking around the office, scenes from company parties, speeches from Holmes and Balwani, and Holmes dancing to \"U Can't Touch This\" by MC Hammer.\n\nShortly after Holmes dropped out of Stanford at age 19, she began dating Theranos president and COO Sunny Balwani, who was 20 years her senior. The two met during Holmes' third year in Stanford\u2019s summer Mandarin program, the summer before she went to college. She was bullied by some of the other students, and Balwani had come to her aid.\n\nBalwani became Holmes' No. 2 at Theranos despite having little experience. He was said to be a bully, and often tracked his employees' whereabouts. Holmes and Balwani eventually broke up in spring 2016 when Holmes pushed him out of the company.\n\nImage credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nIn 2008, the Theranos board decided to remove Holmes as CEO in favor of someone more experienced. But over the course of a two-hour meeting, Holmes convinced them to let her stay in charge of her company.\n\nAs Theranos started to rake in millions of funding, Holmes became the subject of media attention and acclaim in the tech world. She graced the covers of Fortune and Forbes, gave a TED Talk, and spoke on panels with Bill Clinton and Alibaba's Jack Ma.\n\nTheranos quickly began securing outside partnerships. Capital Blue Cross and Cleveland Clinic signed on to offer Theranos tests to their patients, and Walgreens made a deal to open Theranos testing centers in their stores. Theranos also formed a secret partnership with Safeway worth $350 million.\n\nIn 2011, Holmes hired her younger brother, Christian, to work at Theranos, although he didn\u2019t have a medical or science background. Christian Holmes spent his early days at Theranos reading about sports online and recruiting his Duke University fraternity brothers to join the company. People dubbed Holmes and his crew the \"Frat Pack\" and \"Therabros.\"\n\nImage credit: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAt one point, Holmes was the world's youngest self-made female billionaire with a net worth of around $4.5 billion.\n\nHolmes was obsessed with security at Theranos. She asked anyone who visited the company\u2019s headquarters to sign non-disclosure agreements before being allowed in the building, and had security guards escort visitors everywhere \u2014 even to the bathroom.\n\nHolmes hired bodyguards to drive her around in a black Audi sedan. Her nickname was \"Eagle One.\" The windows in her office had bulletproof glass.\n\nAround the same time, questions were being raised about Theranos' technology. Ian Gibbons \u2014 chief scientist at Theranos and one of the company's first hires \u2014 warned Holmes that the tests weren't ready for the public to take, and that there were inaccuracies in the technology. Outside scientists began voicing their concerns about Theranos, too.\n\nBy August 2015, the FDA began investigating Theranos, and regulators from the government body that oversees laboratories found \"major inaccuracies\" in the testing Theranos was doing on patients.\n\nBy October 2015, Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou published his investigation into Theranos's struggles with its technology. Carreyrou's reporting sparked the beginning of the company's downward spiral.\n\nCarreyrou found that Theranos' blood-testing machine, named Edison, couldn't give accurate results, so Theranos was running its samples through the same machines used by traditional blood-testing companies.\n\nImage credit: Carlos Osorio/AP\n\nHolmes appeared on CNBC's Mad Money shortly after the WSJ published its story to defend herself and Theranos. \"This is what happens when you work to change things, and first they think you're crazy, then they fight you, and then all of a sudden you change the world,\" Holmes said.\n\nBy 2016, the FDA, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and SEC were all looking into Theranos.\n\nIn July 2016, Holmes was banned from the lab-testing industry for two years. By October, Theranos had shut down its lab operations and wellness centers.\n\nIn March 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani were charged with \"massive fraud\" by the SEC. Holmes agreed to give up financial and voting control of the company, pay a $500,000 fine, and return 18.9 million shares of Theranos stock. She also isn't allowed to be the director or officer of a publicly traded company for 10 years.\n\nDespite the charges, Holmes was allowed to stay on as CEO of Theranos, since it's a private company. The company had been hanging on by a thread, and Holmes wrote to investors asking for more money to save Theranos. \"In light of where we are, this is no easy ask,\" Holmes wrote.\n\nImage credit: Kimberly White/Getty Images for Fortune\n\nIn Theranos' final days, Holmes reportedly got a Siberian husky puppy named Balto that she brought into the office. However, the dog wasn't potty trained, and would go to the bathroom inside the company's office and during meetings.\n\nIn June 2018, Theranos announced that Holmes was stepping down as CEO. On the same day, the Department of Justice announced that a federal grand jury had charged Holmes, along with Balwani, with nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n\nTheranos sent an email to shareholders in September 2018 announcing that the company was shutting down. Theranos reportedly said it planned to spend the next few months repaying creditors with its remaining resources.\n\nAround the time Theranos' time was coming to an end, Holmes made her first public appearance alongside William \"Billy\" Evans, a 27-year-old heir to a hospitality property management company in California. The two reportedly first met in 2017, and were seen together in 2018 at Burning Man, the art festival in the Nevada desert.\n\nHolmes is said to wear Evans' MIT \"signet ring\" on a chain around her neck, and the couple reportedly posts photos \"professing their love for each other\" on a private Instagram account. Evans' parents are reportedly \"flabbergasted\" at their son's decision to marry Holmes.\n\nFor everyone asking about Holmes's social media. It's private. But here are a few screenshots of her and her fianc\u00e9 we found online. (I personally find it crazy that she's being charged with 11 felony counts, thousands of people's lives were harmed, and she's as happy as can be.) pic.twitter.com/6nYfjltLt4 \u2014 Nick Bilton (@nickbilton) February 21, 2019\n\nIt's unclear where Holmes and Evans currently reside, but they were previously living in a $5,000-a-month apartment in San Francisco until April 2019. The apartment was located just a few blocks from one of the city's top tourist attractions, the famously crooked block of Lombard Street.\n\nIt was later reported that Holmes and Evans got engaged in early 2019, then married in June in a secretive wedding ceremony. Former Theranos employees were reportedly not invited to the wedding, according to Vanity Fair.\n\nHolmes, as well as Balwani, will see their day in court sometime this year. A California judge ruled that the federal trial for Holmes and Balwani is set to start in August 2020.\n\nIf convicted, both Holmes and Balwani could face up to 20 years in prison and a more than $2.7 million fine, the U.S. government has said.\n\nImage credit: Justin Silva/Getty, Stephen Lam/Reuters, Business Insider\n\nBesides the criminal case, Holmes is also involved in a number of civil lawsuits, including one in Arizona brought on by former Theranos patients over inaccurate blood tests. The lawyers representing her in the Arizona case said in late 2019 they hadn't been paid over a year, and asked to be removed from Holmes' legal team.", "author": ["Avery Hartmas", "Paige Leskin"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/sGGScbBjNIM/346053", "published": "2020-02-11T18:00:00", "title": "5 Reasons This 97-Year-Old Marketing Book Is More Relevant Than Ever", "text": "Attention is an asset you must capture and capitalize on in marketing.\n\nFebruary 11, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe 1923 book Scientific Advertising by Claude Hopkins spawned the modern world of direct marketing.

Rather than waste space on high-definition close-ups of airbrushed burritos, they used the entire billboard to show a single sentence:\n\n\u201cWe wanted to write about our locally sourced natural ingredients, but short billboard headlines are better.\u201d\n\nThe sentence was then greyed out except for four words, which remained in black capital letters, spelling out a new sentence: \u201cOUR INGREDIENTS ARE BETTER.\u201d The headline is witty and economical, and even when driving on a highway, you get the message in a brief glance.\n\nAn example shown in Scientific Advertising displays an advert from Mead Cycle Company; the company owner found the ad so lucrative he wouldn\u2019t change a single word. The opening paragraph below makes a clean, compelling proposition.\n\n\u201cTry before you buy. Select the bicycle you prefer from the 44 styles, colors and sizes in the famous Ranger line. We send it on approval and 30 DAYS TRIAL, freight paid to your town. Return if not pleased and the trial costs you nothing.\u201d\n\nAdd charm or detail later. Your first objective in tighter marketing is to communicate your value proposition quickly and well.\n\n2. Measure the data or risk losing money\n\nScientific Advertising is considered one of the first books to tout the benefits of split testing. You must test, measure, and tweak your approach based on the feedback your numbers give you.\n\nMany modern online marketers first encounter split testing through the glory of email marketing, as they use an email service provider to automatically send different subject lines of the same newsletter to a list and determine which subject gets a better engagement rate.\n\nRelated: 9 Sales and Marketing Tips for Startups\n\nBut even Mr. Hopkins\u2019 data measurement techniques of coupon redemption and tracked phone calls hold their weight today both in analog and digital forms. Google UTM parameters are key for an online entrepreneur to correctly track where their website traffic comes from, and the custom links of affiliate marketing have made it an industry seeing double-digit growth each year.\n\nThe approach is simple: test different campaigns, chop the initiatives that fall flat and do more of what works.\n\n3. Leverage human psychology\n\nWe can try to tell ourselves the world is different now and humans have different motivations than they did nearly a hundred years ago. But part of what makes Scientific Advertising so timeless is that the core principles of human psychology really haven't changed all that much.\n\nThe good news, as Mr. Hopkins notes, is that since human psychology is unchanging, once you learn these critical marketing triggers you\u2019ll never have to unlearn them.\n\nA few tactics particularly lauded in chapter six of the book include\n\nCuriosity. Unexpected and exciting details capture the heart and mind of an intrigued consumer.\n\nPrice. Mr. Hopkins highlights that no one likes cheaply made products, yet everyone likes the idea of a deal.\n\nGuarantees. The opportunity to try a product risk-free changes the psychology and defense mechanisms in a buyer\u2019s mind.\n\nSamples. Rather than desperately give out samples to everyone in sight, educate your followers first, and let them ask for a sample or to give the product a try. When the initiative is made by the prospect, psychology is in your corner.\n\nNectar uses the psychology of guarantee to great effect. When Nectar wants to sell you a mattress, they offer you a 365-day trial, more than 3 times their industry competitors. \u201cWhich of these sounds better to you, a 100-day trial or a 365-day trial?\u201d is a powerful headline rooted in psychology.\n\nRelated: Easy Simple Plan for Entrepreneurs to Create a Marketing Plan\n\nEven as photography, videography, and other forms of content production rise in popularity, these psychological triggers continue to run the show behind the scenes. Any entrepreneur looking to market or sell must employ one or more of these tactics to hook a prospect\u2019s interest.\n\n4. Tension relief outsells prevention\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that it\u2019s much easier to identify a consumer\u2019s pain and offer to remove it than it is to encourage precautionary measures. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to be all doom and gloom, but you do want to elicit tension in some way when attempting to persuade others.\n\nMany of Scientific Advertising\u2019s examples still apply today. Toothpaste ads that promise whiter teeth outperform ones that tout the continued prevention of cavities. Soaps that promise more radiant, glowing skin will always outperform a headline like \u201ckeep clean\u201d.\n\nTo move others to act now and not later, focus on trouble and how your product, program or service alleviates that trouble.\n\n5. Consumers buy complete stories\n\nA Nielsen report found that Americans spend an astonishing 11 hours and 27 minutes each day consuming media, a number that has risen year after year.\n\nThat\u2019s because stories sell, whether we\u2019re paying with our dollars or our time. Mr. Hopkins notes that it\u2019s an advertiser\u2019s job to sell a complete story or proposition within a single ad, and then let the consumer decide if they are for or against the proposition.\n\nHopkins notes that, at $10 a word (about $151/word in today\u2019s dollar), every word has to be a \u201csuper-salesman.\u201d It sounds like every word also has to be a \u201csuper-storyteller\u201d, and in this scenario, your value proposition is the story.\n\nMastering marketing\n\nNo matter your industry of expertise, it\u2019s a valuable use of time to learn and master the strategies that persuade people to click or buy.\n\nWhether your dominant marketing approach is SnapChat or direct mail, the principles in Scientific Advertising are timeless, proven, and a tactic you can start putting in place for free today.", "author": ["Nick Wolny"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/5tGT7s6U9ng/345072", "published": "2020-02-11T17:00:00", "title": "Preparing for Showtime: The Job Interview", "text": "Learn how to properly prepare for a job interview and perform well as you interview for new jobs.\n\nFebruary 11, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe following excerpt is from Kanika Tolver\u2019s book Career Rehab.

Use this \u201cJob Interview Preparation Checklist\u201d to create a winning impression:\n\nKnow your personal brand story intimately and be able to express it smoothly to the interview panel.

It\u2019s a great idea to practice with a good friend, spouse, mentor, career coach, or former manager or colleague (if you remain on good terms). Select someone who\u2019ll give you honest, raw feedback.

Start preparing for a job interview 72 hours ahead of time so the information will be fresh in your mind.\n\nRelated: How to Become a Brand, Not an Employee\n\nDon\u2019t bomb the job interview\n\nOne of the biggest fears most professionals have is performing poorly in a job interview. It\u2019s not unlike when a home\u2019s been on the market for a very long time: The owner starts to feel like their well-loved home is a horrible piece of property. It\u2019s the same with us as professionals. But there are good reasons you might bomb a job interview. Some of the most common interview mistakes include not dressing for the part, having a limited knowledge of the company because you didn\u2019t do your research, showing up late, forgetting to bring a hard copy of your resume, and not asking any questions about the company.\n\nOf course, you may be running late through no fault of your own: Maybe a car accident caused a huge, unexpected traffic snarl. Life happens, but it\u2019s vitally important to communicate your potential tardiness before you\u2019re actually late. Call or email the point of contact to let them know the situation and see if you need to reschedule or if they still want you to come to the interview. Similarly, in this digital age, having a hard copy of your resume isn\u2019t always necessary, but it\u2019s better to be prepared than unprepared, so please bring your resume to the job interview.\n\nWhen it comes to dressing for the interview, always try to dress for the company culture and add a few touches of personality. Don\u2019t go over the top, because you want them to focus on your performance, not on what you\u2019re wearing. If you don\u2019t do the proper research, you may not dress correctly. For example, if you wear a suit to an interview at Rolling Stone magazine, it will be obvious that you didn\u2019t research the company, because they don\u2019t have a conservative culture.\n\nIt\u2019ll be very clear to the interview panel if you don\u2019t know anything about the company. Most of the time, the interview panel will give you a brief introduction to the organization, but they want to rate your interest in the company based on what you can tell them about their mission, products and services. So do a deeper dive in your research. Keeping up with the company\u2019s new business announcements, blog posts, or clients will help you develop your list of questions for the interview panel. Try to ask questions that bring that \u201cwow\u201d factor to the conversation.\n\nRelated: Why You Need to Start Dating Jobs\n\nMost professionals will ask standard questions about their role, the company culture and career growth. But you want to ask questions that hook into where you can add value or where they\u2019re trying to go in the future. These may include:\n\nTechnical questions about the role and its responsibilities\n\nGeneral questions about the company culture, growth, diver\u00adsity, or work-life balance\n\nWow-factor questions about a current event or business announcement regarding the company\u2019s future\n\nHas the company recently been in the news for a new innovation? Ask about it! Today, most companies are looking for creative professionals who can add value. As you go into your interview, think outside the box as you discuss your interest in the company. Job interviews are an opportunity to win the panel over with your savviness and business-driven ideas. So think about what type of employees the company would want representing their brand, then sell yourself as a fan or advocate for the company brand.", "author": ["Kanika Tolver"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/mPiimwL0kZM/345845", "published": "2020-02-11T16:30:00", "title": "Four Diet Tricks for a Better Night's Sleep", "text": "More water and less sugar could just be what's between you and your next career jump.\n\nFebruary 11, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou\u2019re tired. The day is dragging on and no matter how hard you try, you can\u2019t summon the energy to get things done. Maybe you\u2019re trying to launch a new business, or gunning for a promotion, but poor energy levels are crippling your productivity.\n\nIt happens to the best of us. A study found that 76 percent of Americans are regularly tired while at work.\n\nFortunately, there are some steps you can take to recapturing your energy. Yes, more hours of sleep is one solution. But many of us struggle with insomnia, and others wake up after a long night's rest still feeling exhausted.\n\nOften, your diet is the source of your lack of energy. It\u2019s easy, especially when you\u2019re busy and stressed, to eat junk foods, processed foods and all the rest. And maybe the occasional trip through the drive-thru is all right, but a habitual bad diet will wreak havoc on your energy levels.\n\nTwo years ago, I was struggling to keep things under control. I'd let the stress of a heavy writing schedule and running my business take a toll on my body. Even as a health and fitness enthusiast who has run 15 marathons, I stepped on the scale one day and was horrified by how much weight I'd gained. I signed up at the nearest OrangeTheory fitness studio and renewed my commitment to working out every day. It helped a little. But thanks to my mid-life metabolism and a propensity to snack on carbs to boost my mental energy while working, I was stuck. The answer, to my chagrin, turned out to be better nutrition habits. I discovered I was eating far too many carbs and far too little protein. Now, I take every opportunity to share my hard-won wisdom with others. Here are four easy diet tips I'd recommend.\n\nConsider a Diet Overhaul such as Keto, Carb Cycling or Intermittent Fasting\n\nGetting the energy you need from your diet isn't always as simple as you think. In fact, even a traditionally healthy diet (read: lots of vegetables, strict calorie intake, etc.) can leave you lacking energy. Of course, everyone's bodies are different, so it's advisable to try out different diets or to work with a nutritionist to see what works for you.\n\nBut in my case, since I discovered I needed more protein and less carbs, I've found a carb cycling program to be really effective. On weekdays, I aim for 40-60 net grams of carbohydrates (you get to subtract one gram of carbs for each gram of fiber) per day, plus 100 grams of protein per day, in 25 gram increments spaced 3-4 hours apart. Balancing healthy fats, the goal is to hit a total of 1200-1800 calories per day. If I need to trim a few pounds I lower the carb level down to 40 or fewer net grams for a period of perhaps 10 days (never more than 14). But I always leave the protein component moderate-to-high at 100 grams per day.\n\nA ketogenic diet is another great option for people looking for more protein in their diet. The keto diet is a very low carb, low sugar, high (healthy) fats die. The idea is that once your body runs out of carbs to use as fuel, it begins to break down fat for energy, putting the body in a metabolic state of \"ketosis.\" Some fitness advocates recommend cycling in and out of keto in a weekly 5/2 cycle (five days on; two days off). In any case, using an app like MyFitnessPal or SparkPeople, which is my personal favorite, which makes it easy to track and analyze what I'm doing in no more than 30 seconds per day.\n\nAnother popular plan for entrepreneurs is Intermittent Fasting (IF). In this program, you consume all food, regardless of the core program, within an 8-hour window that would generally end by 6 or 7 p.m. A nice aspect of this program is that the 15-16 window of fasting occurs largely during your sleep. Advocates of this program generally sleep very soundly because their digestive system is able to rest fully.\n\nEliminate Added Sugars\n\nNot ready to commit to a formal regimen just yet? You're still likely to see boosts in your energy levels by simply reducing added sugars. You\u2019d be surprised how many foods contain added forms of sugar; it's not just in colas and candy bars. Spaghetti sauce, dried fruit and yogurt often contain added sugar even if they appear to be \u201chealthy foods.\u201d\n\nYes, sugar can lead to a short-term energy boost. Your favorite candy bar might seem like a quick pick-me-up. But you'll pay for that temporary high, because sugar rushes are typically followed by blood sugar crashes. You may get a few minutes of increased productivity, but in the hours that follow you will have even lower energy, and crave more sugar. An added benefit of cutting added sugars from your diet is that once you do it, you may find a more radical overhaul (like keto or a low carb diet) more manageable.\n\nAlcohol is a Terrible Nighttime Downer\n\nAlcohol is a powerful sedative. Some whisky on the rocks or a glass of wine might seem like the perfect way to unwind and fall asleep sooner rather than later. But alcohol interferes with deep slumber, so even if you manage to fall asleep earlier after a drink or two, the quality of your sleep will be worse. If you\u2019re looking for drinks to help you sleep, consider chamomile tea or another healthier option instead.\n\nStay Hydrated\n\nSpeaking of the right drinks, water is always the best choice, and you should drink plenty of it. Unfortunately, 75 percent of Americans are chronically dehydrated \u2014 roughly the same number of Americans tired at work.\n\nThat's probably no coincidence, because dehydration can impact your sleep. If you\u2019re dehydrated, you\u2019re more likely to have a dry, itchy throat that irritates you at night, and even the glass of water at your bedside might not be enough to provide relief. Several extra glasses of water earlier in the day, however, could help. Dehydration can also lead to a number of issues like leg cramps, which can wake you up in the middle of the night, disrupting your sleep cycle. You might not even remember waking up, but you\u2019ll feel the impact of a poor night\u2019s sleep come morning.\n\nOverall, our nutritional choices have a huge impact on our ability to get healthy sleep, and how rested we are has a huge impact on how much we can achieve in a given day, week, month or year. However you look at it, we really are what we eat.", "author": ["Cheryl Snapp Conner"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/UVifQ5U9NSc/346211", "published": "2020-02-11T16:12:18", "title": "How to Quickly Update Your LinkedIn Profile", "text": "If you've put off updating your LinkedIn account for too long, don't despair. You can give it an easy but meaningful once-over just by focusing on these five key sections of your profile.\n\nFebruary 11, 2020 7 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on PC Mag\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the year, I asked people if they had any digital organization projects they've been putting off. Even the most productive people have something on their lists. A few people told me they really should update their LinkedIn profile. It's a task they know they should do, but who has the time?\n\nIf you're in a hurry to give your LinkedIn profile the once-over, there are five areas where you should focus your attention:\n\nHeadline Photo Skills & Experience Location \"Open to Recruiters\" status\n\nUpdating these areas will give you the most bang for your buck, in terms of time. Below is a little more information explaining why these have high value and how you can make the most of them.\n\n1. Write a headline that sells you\n\nYour LinkedIn headline is the short statement that appears below your name. That headline is to a recruiter's search what an online headline is to SEO. The headline needs to say what you do or what you want to do. And it should hit those points using keywords.\n\nLet's say you currently work as an editorial assistant at Jolly Magazine, but you have prior experience as an editor and writer. You want your career to move toward more writing and editing. Your headline should use the words \"writer\" and \"editor.\"\n\nRelated: The 7 Deadly LinkedIn Sins\n\nIf, however, you want to push your career into covering local news, then you need to reflect that. \"Writer and editor\" might still fit, but you'll need to include \"news\" and \"journalism\" in there, too. You might end up with something like this:\n\nWriter and Editor | Passionate about local news journalism\n\nThat headline has the right keywords, indicates where the person wants to take their career, and doesn't stretch the truth.\n\nPeople who haven't updated their LinkedIn profiles in a while might have their current job title followed by a comma and then their employer or department name. That's fine, but it might leave out some of the keywords you want to use. What are the chances a recruiter is searching for an \"editorial assistant at Jolly\" versus \"local news editor?\" The words in your headline need to match the job you want.\n\nDo you need to pay for a professional headshot for LinkedIn? No, you really don't.\n\nUnless you work in photography, modeling, or acting, the headshot is something of a formality. A great profile picture won't get you an interview, but a terrible picture (inappropriate, creepy) could be the reason a recruiter weeds you out.\n\nTo take a photo, enlist the help or a friend or family member. Put on an appropriate shirt because it might show up in the final picture, and try to smile. A scowl or a creepy smirk isn't going to go over well. Go outside into natural daylight. Stand in front of a neutral background that doesn't cast any obvious shadows. Have your friend frame your head so that you get a little bit of your shoulders in the photo too. You can always crop it. Take at least 15 pictures, right from the outset. If you have 15, one of them is bound to be decent.\n\nRelated: The Underrated Power of LinkedIn Content Creation\n\nTo be fair, I have mixed feelings about using photos on LinkedIn at all. Before the internet era, job seekers in the US were told to never put their picture on a resume (though it's long been customary in other countries), much less other personal information such as marital status or birthdate. Those are all potential points of discrimination. Today, it's hard to get around the fact that anyone can try to find your photo and other details about you online. At least with LinkedIn, you are in control of the image that appears.\n\n3. Punch up your keywords\n\nKeywords appear in a few places on your LinkedIn profile. The most important place they appear is in your headline. The second most important place is in Skills & Endorsements.\n\nThe Skills & Endorsements area is nothing more than a list of keywords. When recruiters are hunting for candidates on LinkedIn, they enter requirements that the employer gives them. The requirements are usually a list of skills. So, to increase your chances of getting a job that lines up with your skills, make sure you hit all the top words that reflect your experience here. When you open this area to update it, LinkedIn suggests skills to you.\n\nBecause your skills here are keyword matches, be sure to list even the most obvious ones. Machines are reading them more than humans. If you're a programmer who has held four jobs as a programmer, you should still add \"programming\" to your skill set. You should also add the languages you use for programming.\n\nSpeaking of languages, if you're comfortable speaking, reading, or writing in more than one language, you can add them to your skills, too.\n\n4. Open up your geography\n\nLinkedIn requires you to say that you are somewhere. At a minimum, you have to name a country. Beyond that, how much information you enter is up to you.\n\nIf you're looking for work, it helps to give a specific location. In the US, you have to enter a ZIP code to get a list of possibilities. Depending on where you are, you might see the name of a city, town, or county. If you're within the limits of a greater city area, like the Washington D.C. Metro area or Miami/Fort Lauderdale, choosing it instead of the city will help you cast a wider net.\n\nRelated: The Biggest Mistake You're Making on LinkedIn and What You Should Do Instead\n\nIf you currently live in one location and are planning to relocate to another where you're job-hunting, consider updating your location before you actually move. It can take months between the time an organization or recruiter expresses interest in a candidate and when they get a job offer or agree on a start date. You might as well get a two- or three-week jump start.\n\nAs you'll see in the next tip, you can indicate you're interested in jobs in other locations, but not in this \"where you live\" section.\n\n5. Indicate you're open to recruiters\n\nAnnouncing yourself as a prospective job candidate doesn't go over well when you're currently employed elsewhere. So LinkedIn has a setting you can turn on tells only recruiters on its site that you're open to being contacted about new opportunities. When you turn on this setting, no one else can see it, only people who have recruiter accounts.\n\nGo to your profile and look just below your headline. When you click to enable this feature, LinkedIn asks for more information, including potential job titles and locations where you're willing to work. Here, you can add more locations besides the city and region near your ZIP code.\n\nIt also asks you to indicate \"job type,\" meaning full-time, part-time, or contract work. Pay close attention to that last section, as it also contains an option for remote work. If you're interested in working from home\u2014sometimes also called telework or telecommuting\u2014be sure to opt in here.\n\nRelated: Why LinkedIn Direct Messaging Is Your Best New Sales Tool", "author": ["Jill Duffy"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/NSI9MpmPE0o/346209", "published": "2020-02-11T16:00:00", "title": "The Green Berets Who Traded Bullets for Bourbon", "text": "Their covert mission into Afghanistan inspired a book, a movie, a monument and now, an award-winning bourbon.\n\nFebruary 11, 2020 2 min read\n\nThis week's episode of Get a Real Job focuses on a group of brave men who have chosen action over safety for their entire lives.\n\nIn the days after 9/11, while many Americans were watching the news in a state of shock and horror, a team of 12 Green Berets covertly entered Afghanistan and waged war against the Taliban ... on horseback.\n\nRiding horses as they penetrated the forbidding landscape of Afghanistan wasn't part of the plan.

I\u2019ve run a game on everybody, and they\u2019re going to find me out.'\"\n\nThis feeling, often prevalent in high-achieving people, is commonly known as \"imposter syndrome.\"\n\nImposter syndrome is a thought pattern where a person has a persistent fear of being exposed as a \u201cfraud,\u201d and which makes that person doubt himself and/or minimize their accomplishments.\n\nRecently Authority Magazine interviewed dozens of high-achieving C-suite executives and leaders who all shared their own experiences overcoming imposter syndrome, as well as the advice they recommend for getting past it.\n\nEnjoy 10 highlights of their interviews below.\n\nThese interviews have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMikaela Kiner (CEO of Reverb)\n\nImage credit: via Authority Magazine\n\nMy experience struggling with imposter syndrome.\n\nIn the summer of 2018 while I was working on my book, a journalist from The Wall Street Journal asked to interview me for her \"Work and Family\" column. When I looked at who else she had featured, I saw people with big titles and important roles, and I wondered, \u201cWhy would she want to hear my story?\u201d\n\nI saw myself as less accomplished and less relevant. I had to remind myself that in the past, I\u2019ve held senior roles in global organizations, and I realize my experiences at these places counted. Not only did I enjoy our conversation, we spoke again many months later on a different topic. In the end I was quoted twice and met a wonderful woman who I now consider an ally.\n\nWhat I did to shake the feeling off.\n\nEarly in my career before I ever heard of impostor syndrome, I lived with it all the time. I would walk into a meeting at work and wonder \u201cDo they like me? Am I smart enough to be here?\u201d It took me several years before I walked into a room and asked myself \u201cDo I like them? Are these people I respect and admire?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s possible to be entirely rid of impostor syndrome but I do manage it better today. What has helped me is learning to recognize it so I can deal with my feelings rationally and talk myself down.\n\nLast year my colleague Elizabeth Bastoni shared some advice that really helped. She said \u201cDon\u2019t say no to yourself, let other people do that for you.\u201d When I start talking myself out of an opportunity or favor because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m worth it, her words are a good reminder to put myself out there and let others decide. More often than not, their answer is yes.\n\n5 Steps someone experiencing imposter syndrome can take to move forward, despite feeling like an \u201cimposter.\"\n\nName it. You can\u2019t prevent thoughts and feelings of impostor syndrome but when you name them, you can overcome them. Label impostor syndrome for what it is. Choose a mantra. Counter those feelings with a mantra like Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cI am good enough.\u201d Gather data. List the facts and data about your qualifications and achievements to remind yourself that you are indeed accomplished and deserving. Create an impostor box. When you experience self-doubt, write your feelings down, tuck them away, and get on with your day. Revisit them when you\u2019re ready, on your terms. Find a friend. There\u2019s nothing like confiding in someone you trust who can talk you off a ledge and help you see yourself for the talented, capable person you are.\n\nStevon Lewis (Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist)\n\nImage credit: via Authority Magazine\n\nMy experience struggling with imposter syndrome.\n\nAs a black male therapist, I haven\u2019t always had an example to follow or model myself after. In my graduate program I was the only black male in my program the entire time I was there. I think this experience led to my questioning whether or not I knew what I was doing. I don\u2019t have an example to follow to effectively evaluate my trajectory and therefore, enter into effective questioning if I will be successful.\n\nWhat I did to shake the feeling off.\n\nI continually overcome any feelings of being an impostor. I use the same techniques and skills I teach my clients. I tell myself, when exploring a new opportunity, I successsfully explore other new opportunities in the past and will continue to so with new ventures. Moreover, I try to tell myself I am doing a good job, and look at the evidence that supports this.\n\n5 steps someone experiencing imposter syndrome can take to move forward, despite feeling like an \u201cimposter.\"\n\nBe relentless in challenging your \"inner bully.\u201d The inner bully is that inner voice we all have that makes us question our abilities and self-worth. Listening to it often leads us to feel more negatively about ourselves, our futures and our present circumstances. For example, in a relationship,an inner bully might prey on our thoughts or feeling as though we don\u2019t deserve our significant other. Often times this will cause us to act in ways that prevent intimacy and connection. We become increasingly angry, clingy, jealous, defensive or easily offended. If our partners are less talkative on a particular day, our inner bullies get us to believe they are mad at us for something we did. We will blindly believe our inner bully instead of checking in to see if our significant other may not feel good, or if there is some other rational explanation for their silence. Create an evidence sheet. A physical paper or a digital notebook where you list all of the evidence that counteracts support your negative view of yourself as a fraud. This is not based on whether you agree with the information, as we know people that struggle with impostor syndrome will often explain away the evidence they receive that suggests they aren\u2019t a fraud. The goal is to continually add to the document to show oneself that their feelings of being a fraud aren\u2019t based in reality. Stop dismissing or minimizing your accomplishments. Individuals that struggle with impostor syndrome often dismiss or minimize their accomplishments as routine. I teach my clients to celebrate themselves by acknowledging their accomplishments. The idea is that even if their accomplishment has become routine, that doesn't mean it shouldn\u2019t be acknowledged. In addition, if we disproportionately highlight our shortfalls \u2014 while ignoring our successes \u2014 we all inevitably end up feeling like a failure. Temper your expectations of yourself. People that struggle with impostor syndrome frequently hold themselves to a standard of perfection that isn\u2019t sustainable or achievable. If you are like this, you may convince yourself you are failing. It would be better for you to temper expectations by using scaling techniques to evaluate their performance. For example, if you have a list of 10 things to accomplish and you accomplish 9 out of 10, it would be more effective to say you've accomplish 90 percent of your plans, as well as reminding yourself that 90 percent is still an \"A.\" Stop comparing yourself to others. In working with individuals that struggle with impostor syndrome, the most toxic behavior you can exhibit is using the lives and accomplishments of others to negatively evaluate yourself. I often hear, from my clients, how others are superior in their abilities and, as a result, are more deserving of success. Individuals with impostor syndrome need to stop measuring their abilities and journey based on someone else\u2019s model. It\u2019s okay to take a different route to get to the same location; some people like to fly, while others prefer to drive.\n\nLiz Forkin Bohannon (Founder of Sseko Designs)\n\nImage credit: via Authority Magazine\n\nMy experience struggling with imposter syndrome.\n\nAlthough I\u2019ve been quite familiar with the feeling from early on in my life, imposter syndrome really started to rear its ugly head up when I was about five-six years into my career of building Sseko Designs. We had to build a traditional wholesale/retail company and were considering pivoting to a direct sales model. I believe the opportunity to od business and make an impact was immense, but so was the risk. At this point, I had a multi-million dollar company with employees and partners across multiple countries. I started feeling like if I tried to lead us through this pivot and failed, that would be the moment when I got \u201cfound out\u201d for being an imposter. Everyone would say, \u201cSee. She is not a real leader or business person. It was all just \u2018beginner\u2019s luck.\u2019\u201d As a result, I had an incredible amount of insecurity and anxiety.\n\nWhat I did to shake the feeling off:\n\nI may not have gotten rid of it completely, but enough that I was able to move forward \u2014 and I am glad that I did! In our first full year of selling through individual women in their communities, we did more in revenue and impact than we had ever done through our wholesale channel! In order to overcome it, I revisited the earliest days of my career and started studying the mentalities and mindsets I had they helped me resist imposter syndrome without even knowing it. My study of those mentalities and mindsets was such an \u201ca-ha\u201d moment to me that I ended up writing an entire book about it so that others can access their \u201cInner Beginner\u201d as a way of overcoming imposter syndrome so that you can build a life of purpose, passion and impact.\n\n5 Steps someone experiencing imposter syndrome can take to move forward, despite feeling like an \u201cimposter.\"\n\nOwn your average. Despite all the common self-help talk that wants you to focus on your specialness, I propose you start warding off imposter syndrome by owning the fact that you are likely indeed quite average. When you \"own your average,\" you will stop only saying yes to the things you think you\u2019ll immediately excel in. When you own your average, you start to realize that no one is thinking about you quite as much as you think they are. You are not Beyonce\u0301. (Or maybe you are \u2014 hi, Beyonce\u0301!). When you decide to own your average, you will start to believe that success will require lots and lots of work, and is not just an inevitable result of being born awesome. You also realize that your insecurities and failures aren\u2019t the tell-tale sign that you\u2019re below average. You know that mistakes and wrong turns are simply a requisite on the road to building an above-average life of purpose and passion, which means you\u2019ll be less afraid to fail and flail a bit. And more importantly, you\u2019ll become less afraid and more likely to succeed, perhaps wildly, because you truly believe you\u2019re just as worthy and likely to build an extraordinary life of purpose and passion as anyone else. Choose curiosity over criticism. There is scientific evidence that suggests curiosity is just as important as IQ in achieving long-term success. Also, it is the ultimate defense against imposter syndrome. The more curious you are, the more able you are to tolerate ambiguity, navigate complexity and acquire knowledge over time. Studies have shown that increased curiosity is associated with less defensive reactions to stress and less aggressive reactions to provocation. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to increase your IQ but you can increase your CQ, or \"curiosity quotient.\" Think like a journalist. Here is the thing about great journalists: They don\u2019t go into the story assuming they have it all figured out. In fact, they know that the less you think you have it all figured out, the more you can learn. The less you have riding on what you think you need to \u201cdiscover,\u201d the freer you will be to get closer to the actual truth, whatever it may be. The more open you are to be surprised by what you uncover, the more likely you will be to find something really interesting. By pretending to be a journalist on assignment in your own life, you\u2019re going to be more likely to find the truest story which will enable you to be more successful. It\u2019s also going to de-shame not knowing everything and will reframe it as an asset which will kick imposter syndrome to the curb. Focus on the problem instead of the solution. Feeling like we have to come up with the best solution off the bat will keep us living under the sea of imposter syndrome. Instead, strive to connect with people who can find and understand really interesting problems, and therefore help us detach our egos from the solution. It gives us more freedom to try and fail, all the while keeping the problem we set out to solve in the starring role it deserves. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help along the way. If you\u2019re the first to admit you\u2019re in a \"learning mode\" and might need some help, it takes the power of the fear that someone else might say it first away. And here is the really cool thing: Contrary to popular belief, studies show that when we\u2019re able to help someone out, we, the helper, end up having increased affection and perceived closeness towards the person we helped.\n\nKim Perell (Author, Angel Investor and CEO)\n\nImage credit: via Authority Magazine\n\nMy experience struggling with imposter syndrome:\n\nAbsolutely. When I first started my own company, I was terrified and young. I had just gotten fired and broke. Everyone doubted me. And even though I chose to press forward, block their voices out and believe in myself. Predictably, I was still terrified. But I felt the fear and did it anyway. Ultimately, your confidence must be greater than your doubt. As an entrepreneur and executive, a huge part of success is that you keep going despite doubt and uncertainty.\n\nWhat I did to shake the feeling off:\n\nI believe I did. Rather than focus on feelings of self-doubt or worry, I focused on my vision and my passion. I zeroed in on the things I wanted to achieve and the things that made me feel grateful to be alive. These were the things that were the most authentic and true to me.\n\nI also learned to master my emotions. Sometimes, we act as though fear and self-doubt are real and true facts. Really, they\u2019re just emotions that are only as powerful as we make them. I stopped allowing those feelings to overwhelm me or distort my reality.\n\nI\u2019ve also made an effort to surround myself with successful people who support me and challenge me.\n\n5 Steps one experiencing imposter syndrome can take to move forward, despite feeling like an \u201cimposter\u201d:\n\nTalk about it. A few years ago, a CEO of a company I invested in called me and said, \u201cDo you ever feel like you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and you have all these people looking at you for leadership but you doubt yourself?\u201d\n\nHis question surprised me for a few reasons. For one, I was shocked to hear that he felt that way. He had always struck me as someone who was so self-assured and capable. I had nothing but confidence in his abilities. I was also surprised because his worries were so familiar to me. I knew exactly how he felt. I\u2019d felt that way countless times early on. Talking out how you feel with successful people you trust can help you realize how common and normal your feelings are. It can also help you see the way you look through their eyes. Invest in relationships. Surround yourself with successful people who want your success to continue. Find a mentor and peers who see your potential and believe you deserve to be where you are. I believe, at any given time, that you should have a mentor, engage in mentoring somebody else, and possess a group of peers who are at your level with whom to share resources, cross-references and gut checks. Master your emotions. Too often, we act as though fear and self-doubt are facts, when really they\u2019re just emotions that are only as powerful as we make them. Don\u2019t let those feelings overwhelm you or distort your reality. Choose to listen to positive emotions like self-belief, trust and hope; give less weight to negative feelings or self-talk. The belief in yourself must be greater than anyone else\u2019s doubt \u2014 including your own. Stop comparing yourself to others. Focus on being the best version of yourself and embrace what makes you different and unique. Everyone has their own special talents; the key is to find yours and execute on what you are good at. What other people have or haven\u2019t accomplished has nothing to do with you. Focus on your own journey. It\u2019s the best way to make sure you\u2019re staying true to yourself and not trying to become someone else. Focus on your vision and passion. Zero in on the things you want to achieve. Set a clear, specific, meaningful vision of something you want to accomplish. Then, make that your North Star. Let it guide everything you do. I always write down my vision and put it on my bathroom mirror so I\u2019m reminded of it every single day.\n\nAnd make sure you\u2019re devoting plenty of time to your passions, the things you\u2019re willing to sacrifice for, things that make me feel grateful to be alive. Because those are the things that are the most authentic and true to you. They\u2019re the things you were truly meant to do, regardless of abilities or talents.\n\nMichael O\u2019Brien (Executive Coach at Peloton Executive Coaching)\n\nImage credit: via Authority Magazine\n\nMy experience struggling with imposter syndrome:\n\nMy first experience with imposter syndrome came after I was promoted to National Sales Director. I started to believe that the only reason I got the job was that I was the only candidate willing to move to New Jersey. I also thought I had to lead like all the National Sales Directors in my industry, but that wasn\u2019t my style. As a result, I lost my identity for a few months. It was an extremely stressful period and I wondered if I was the right person for the job. These feelings stayed with me until I shifted my thinking and regained my confidence.\n\nWhat I did to shake the feeling off:\n\nYes, I was able to shake off my imposter syndrome by shifting the conversation I was having with myself by developing a list fo accomplishments and a few mantras to remind myself why I was promoted. I also started looking for small wins, which I knew would lead to bigger ones down the road, which they did.\n\n5 Steps someone experiencing imposter syndrome can take to move forward, despite feeling like an \u201cimposter\u201d:\n\n1. Breathe. When imposter syndrome is present, it\u2019s common for your head to be spinning and be filled with emotion. It makes it hard to know what to do next. Focusing on your breath slows you down, shifts your perspective, and sparks a healthier self-narrative.\n\n2. Create an accomplishments list. Develop a list of life and career accomplishments and mantras that will help you counter-balance your self-narrative when it gets negative or anxious. You can develop your list in private and then ask others what strengths they see in you.\n\n3. Develop your network. Since life and career are not solo projects, it\u2019s essential to have a strong network. They can help you see attributes you might not realize \u2014 especially when you can\u2019t.\n\n4. Celebrate small wins. Look for small victories to gain the type of momentum that will lead to big wins down the road and reframe your situation.\n\n5. Express gratitude. Develop a gratitude practice to help you see what\u2019s working in your life. You can even be grateful for your moments of self-doubt or feeling like a fraud because they are a natural part of being alive and an opportunity to show yourself and the world that you are gritty.\n\nRicky Joshi (CEO of The Saatva Company)\n\nImage credit: via Authority Magazine\n\nMy experience struggling with imposter syndrome:\n\nAbsolutely! Coming from the agency world meant I was well-versed in business. My interest in lifestyle was strong, but as I worked on the business model, attended events, and met other professionals, there were definitely times where I felt like I did not know what I was doing. While I knew intrinsically that I was competent, I found difficulty in navigating this new space with my new company. That\u2019s what\u2019s so tricky about imposter syndrome: you know you\u2019re good, but it doesn\u2019t always show.\n\nWhat I did to shake the feeling off:\n\nYes, through consistency, I was able to work my way out of it. Every time I accomplished something, I would remind myself that it was because of my talents and perseverance, and how I deserved to be there.\n\n5 Steps someone experiencing imposter syndrome can take to move forward, despite feeling like an \u201cimposter\u201d:\n\nBelieve in your talents. Always look at your talent as the base rather than focusing on the task. If you know you can achieve something because of past experiences, then keep that at the forefront of your mind. Ask for help. I was fortunate enough to have Ron through this journey, but friends and colleagues are a great support system when you need a reminder. Start small. If something seems too daunting, make sure that you scale back and start with something small and manageable. Once you conquer that, it\u2019ll be easier for you to conquer future, larger tasks. Visualize your success. Keep your eye on the prize and look forward to what you want to achieve rather than playing into your doubts. Prepare for disappointment. This is key. It does not mean anticipate failure; it means come up with a plan in case of failure. How will you move forward after the fact? Putting these in place early can help you navigate tricky personal feelings.\n\nElena Doukas (Design Director at Garrett Leight California Optical)\n\nImage credit: via Authority Magazine\n\nMy experience struggling with imposter syndrome.\n\nMy education was in fashion design, and although there are many parallels from apparel design to product design, I\u2019ve always regretted having not taken product design courses. When I started building out the design team at Garrett Leight, I was nervous that candidates with way more product design skills would not respect me as a boss, or that I wouldn\u2019t know what were the magic ingredients were needed to build a strong team. Designing frames was something I was grasping quickly, but managing a team was something I had never done.\n\nOn the flip side, when we were first starting out as a company, there were only a few of us, and I had horrible work life balance. I would stay at the office late, and lost touch with a few friends and had trouble giving my friend base the time they deserved. I also had no time to network or interact with any type of peer group, which made me feel like an imposter when I started interacting in fashion circles. It was like an imposter pendulum; on one side I felt not technical enough, and on the other side not connected enough. I was in my late-20s introducing myself as a design director of an eyewear company with no previous eyewear experience, and bracing myself for questions about how I got the job. I knew I got this opportunity from a combination of hard work and luck, but would constantly question if I was truly the most qualified person for the job.\n\nWhat I did to shake the feeling off.\n\nAs the company grew, I wasn\u2019t always able to have a clear vision of how I wanted to personally grow. I realized I needed to make some changes and give more balance to my life. I think the most confusing part for me was how I evolved through my job. When I was hired, the company needed me to do a lot of roles (i.e. design, development, production and sales), but as we grew, I was expected to be an expert in a specific field. It was difficult for me to adapt, and there was no magic ball telling me exactly how I had to change. There was no how-to guide on building and managing a team, and giving direction.\n\nHowever, I got some good advice from one of my mentors to really understand what my best strengths were, and had a real constructive conversation on the things I wasn\u2019t good at. The irony is the I was advice I was told was the following: No one is ever blessed with knowing exactly how to do everything. It\u2019s the journey of figuring it out that helps you learn how to do things and continuing to perfect your process.\n\n5 Steps one experiencing imposter syndrome can take to move forward, despite feeling like an \u201cimposter.\"\n\nGet organized. I think common result of imposter syndrome is either procrastination or anxiety. If I find myself freezing up or on the opposite end approaching a project sporadically, I try to get myself organized. I think a huge stereotype is that creative people are unorganized, where I think a lot creatives actually thrive in an organized environment, and they just need to find the best structure for them. Try to schedule out time for yourself when you\u2019re at your best to tackle your most overwhelming issues. For me it\u2019s early mornings, before I\u2019ve checked my phone or email so I have zero distractions. Bullet journaling, which is a daily free form journal, is something I actively do to keep myself organized, and really has helped me not push things to the side. If you google Bullet Journal, don\u2019t compare your journal to the thousands of journal images showing perfect penmanship, art doodles and different colored pens. As much as I envy some of these peoples art skills, it\u2019s absolutely insane to think you should spend that much time working on making your bullet journal perfect. The whole point is to free mind up so you can focus on more important things. Rinse and repeat (but with intent). Growing up I played competitive soccer and I had a coach who started every practice saying, \u201cPractice doesn\u2019t make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until after I graduated college that I realized the intent of this saying wasn\u2019t to become a perfectionist, but it was to be present in every moment you are working on your goal. Now in my job, I\u2019ve also learned to embrace doing multiple iterations of a design and work on them in the full extent. Even when I think it\u2019s finished, I\u2019ll try doing several more. It\u2019s in the process of exploring all the possibilities that you find something new and original, even if the first version ends up being the one you go with. Mentor. I\u2019m very grateful to have several mentors in my life, and can\u2019t stress enough how important I think it is to have a soundboard. My brother in law is in a line of work where he\u2019s frequently meeting with investors, and he shared with me that in almost every investor meeting a commonly asked question is, \u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d which equates to who in your circle is giving you advice and are they smarter than you? Quite frankly, you\u2019re probably not the smartest person on any one subject, and there\u2019s a bit of relief in admitting it and finding guidance from someone who is. I learned from Garrett not to design in a bubble, and he actively pushes me to get feedback from others outside of the office on designs. Peer relationships. Having close friends that can call you on your bullshit is equally as important as having a peer group within your industry. I now have several friends who are in fashion and eyewear, and a lot of our relationships are built around a support system we give to each other. Wellness program. Work life balance is a must for me. Find an activity or routine that allows you to turn your brain off and give back to yourself. Yoga has been my way of turning off, and is a practice in itself of learning to shut down a wandering mind. I\u2019ve learned that the reaction of letting your mind wander to negative thoughts is actually possible to shut down, but it takes practice.\n\nDavid Metzler (CEO of CBD Capital Group)\n\nImage credit: via Authority Magazine\n\nMy experience struggling with imposter syndrome:\n\nWhen I first began my career, I was involved in large-scale investment companies. Having graduated from Columbia as a veteran, I climbed the ranks quickly as the company positioned me strategically with important clients that value veterans. As I looked around at the high-level executives around me, I felt like I didn\u2019t deserve to be at the top with them. As a result, I felt like I couldn\u2019t ask the questions necessary to understand a subject because I worried that people will see me as not smart. Knowing that tendency, I created a rule for me that I would only create teams of experts, where I didn\u2019t need to be the \u201csmartest guy in the room.\u201d That allowed me to always be surrounded by the best professionals, and ask all the questions I needed to truly master and solve any situation or problem that arises.\n\nWhat I did to shake the feeling off:\n\nYes, but not without practice. I spent years accruing experience doing what I love and surrounding myself with other successful entrepreneurs. As success came in each endeavor, I realized that I do have the ability to lead and create the life I want.\n\n5 Steps someone experiencing imposter syndrome can take to move forward, despite feeling like an \u201cimposter\u201d:\n\nLook to your strengths. Take a look inside yourself and list out your five largest strengths that have contributed to your success. Think about your career goals. Consider your goals one, five and ten years from now. Analyze your weaknesses. Ask yourself, what are your biggest weaknesses that you\u2019re afraid people will discover. And how can you develop those strengths to achieve your goals? Surround yourself with other successful people. You are who you surround yourself with. Believe in yourself. Take that step. Make those decisions based on what you think the best choice is and adapt to what happens and learns.\n\nMary Rinaldi (Co-Founder of Simone)\n\nImage credit: via Authority Magazine\n\nMy experience struggling with imposter syndrome:\n\nAfter building hedge fund products at an investment firm, one of our partners who I worked with closely on a successful project wanted to hire me into their firm. This firm was one of the best \u2014 highly ethical and extremely well-respected. Even better, the team I was to join was run by one of the smartest, kindest women I met during my short career in finance. Despite these positives, I was certain I would fail if I took the offer. I was fundamentally afraid that without the pedigree (since every single person there had attended The Wharton School of Business), the degree in Economics (my degree was in literature and history), and a coveted CFA II certificate, I would last for a few months and then be fired. Looking back, I would have flourished. It was a perfect role for me: It combined my love of explicating structure and process, integral to how a portfolio is built, and communicating outcomes, integral to the explanation of how a portfolio performed. Sadly in the end, I didn't take the role.\n\nWhat I did to shake the feeling off:\n\nI don\u2019t think people with imposter syndrome permanently eliminate the feeling, since it\u2019s about alignment between your internal self and how you are perceived by the world. But I\u2019ve found some tools to change the internal dialogue about that process. How we work \u2014 listening, teaching, and making \u2014 can be the best tool for that.\n\nFor example, I\u2019ve accepted that I don\u2019t pop-up out of bed at 5:30 AM, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t make a habit of it and make it last for years. I\u2019ve learned that general productivity \u2014 clocking good hours at my job, meeting professional goals, expanding my network \u2014 isn\u2019t what I really want. The grueling schedule required a level of anxiety that kept me from the work I really wanted to do. So now, I wake up around 8:00 AM, and I read or write for an hour with a cup of coffee. This way, I arrive at work with clarity and intention. From this routine, I now have multiple essays in progress, a few new roles I\u2019m going after and more warmth and generosity to offer others.\n\n5 Steps someone experiencing imposter syndrome can take to move forward, despite feeling like an \u201cimposter\u201d:\n\nOwn the problem. The first step is stating that there is a problem, defining what it is without blaming anyone and then getting feedback. For me, this took the form of telling a close friend about my crippling anxiety and how I was to overcome it. She recommended a book (\"The Artist's Way\") for me to begin my work with it, and it was life-changing. Get into the world around you. Take walks, ride your bike, notice people, count oddities of nature and notice the cracks in the sidewalk. While I was on a mission to overcome creative paralysis brought on by imposter syndrome, I enrolled in a course called \"Drawing for Writers.\" I learned how to observe, learned how to be present and find honesty and courage in my writing. Take your time. Luxuriate in the time it takes to change with no particular outcome other than feeling less anxiety about whether or not you\u2019re worthy of your life, job or what you want. Time is elastic, so just go with it. Move quickly when you need to and move slowly when you need to. It will change your perception of the world. Be honest. Self-criticism is the hallmark of imposter syndrome, especially sweeping declarative insults that are patently untrue. For example, saying to yourself, \u201cYou really suck at pitching ideas. Your ideas are boring and really bad. You don\u2019t deserve your job at all\u201d is a dead end. If you choose to be honest and say, \u201cI\u2019m nervous about today, because I don\u2019t feel connected to this idea and afraid my pitch is going to go poorly,\u201d you\u2019ve just found the way forward and clarified the options. You might have a teammate help you out with the pitch, or interrogate what you feel is missing from the idea. Or you may accept that this one may not go your way and take time for rest and refreshment. Be disciplined. Practice, practice, practice! As you find time throughout your week to do all these things, ritualize them. Changing the conversation is an ongoing practice. You will experience setbacks and anxious moments, and how you respond to them will have a big impact on the steadiness of your outlook. Healthy emotional and mental grooves help us persist through difficulty.\n\nMike Hondorp (CMO of Whalar)\n\nImage credit: via Authority Magazine\n\nMy experience struggling with imposter syndrome:\n\nI really started to feel like an imposter as my job grew at Facebook. Facebook was a place for crazy-smart, high-achieving, really young people. To go from more traditional corporate jobs to a role at job fast-growing and boundary-breaking tech company turned the idea hierarchy on its head for me. Suddenly, I wasn\u2019t sure if I could measure up. Though it was humbling to feel like I wasn\u2019t qualified enough to even be in the room with some of these people.\n\nIn my role, I was meeting with the heads of marketing for big global companies, and even though I had less experience than they did, they would listen so attentively my counsel about Instagram because the platform was so new, and they trusted you to guide them through it. Despite this authority, I did not know what I had done to earn their trust. And I often felt like I was just there.\n\nWhat I did to shake the feeling off:\n\nFor me, it never goes away, and it never feels like I\u2019m achieving enough. I minimize this by continuing to prove my value and focusing on the work itself. I also try to redefine what a C-level executive does and how they behave, to make it more authentic and approachable than people can sometimes think of senior leadership being. For example, I really like relating to people on a human level \u2014 it\u2019s fun to understand what motivates people, what their home life is like, what music they\u2019re into, and just be fun and silly sometimes. It's through these moments is when we build connections with each other.\n\n5 Steps one experiencing imposter syndrome can take to move forward, despite feeling like an \u201cimposter\u201d:", "author": ["Candice Georgiadis"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/SA8ZUUSqalI/346174", "published": "2020-02-11T13:45:00", "title": "Step Up Your Branding With This Library of Pro Vector Assets, Now Less Than $35", "text": "Build your brand with these one-of-a-kind vectors.\n\nFebruary 11, 2020 1 min read\n\nDisclosure: Our goal is to feature products and services that we think you'll find interesting and useful.

It\u2019s lauded by many legendary marketers and copywriters of the 20th century, including agency king David Ogilvy and legendary copywriter Gary Halbert, and its message has only become more relevant in the digital age.\n\nWhile controversy still brews over whether our attention spans have actually shortened, the opportunities to fracture our concentration \u2014 whether it be multiple tabs on a browser screen or texting while driving--have likely arisen with the proliferation of the smartphone. Entrepreneurs are tasked with capturing the undivided attention of their prospect faster than ever before.\n\nRelated: 10 Marketing Strategies to Fuel Your Business Growth\n\nVideo marketing, perfect Instagram feeds, and impressive TikTok filters blast us with flashing lights and novelty. But when it comes to influence and sales, the pillars of persuasion outlined in Scientific Advertising have remained largely the same. (The book is even public domain and you can read it in its entirety for free right now.)\n\nAs a content marketer, I\u2019m working day in and day out to capture and hold users\u2019 attention in the most cost-effective way possible. The principles of Mr. Hopkins\u2019 seminal book enable me to deliver on that, as they\u2019re considered a cornerstone of direct response marketing.\n\nHere are 5 important points from the book that still apply nearly a century later\n\n1. To capture attention, create clarity\n\nMr. Hopkins comes out swinging, noting that \u201cfine talkers are rarely good salesmen.\u201d\n\nIt can be tempting to slide into industry jargon or fancy language, but often this attempt to come off as smart or commanding backfires. When your reader has to strain to comprehend your pitch, they lose interest and move on.\n\nRelated: Digital Marketing Hacks for 2020\n\nChipotle nailed this approach in a recent billboard campaign. Rather than waste space on high-definition close-ups of airbrushed burritos, they used the entire billboard to show a single sentence:\n\n\u201cWe wanted to write about our locally sourced natural ingredients, but short billboard headlines are better.\u201d\n\nThe sentence was then greyed out except for four words, which remained in black capital letters, spelling out a new sentence: \u201cOUR INGREDIENTS ARE BETTER.\u201d The headline is witty and economical, and even when driving on a highway, you get the message in a brief glance.\n\nAn example shown in Scientific Advertising displays an advert from Mead Cycle Company; the company owner found the ad so lucrative he wouldn\u2019t change a single word. The opening paragraph below makes a clean, compelling proposition.\n\n\u201cTry before you buy. Select the bicycle you prefer from the 44 styles, colors and sizes in the famous Ranger line. We send it on approval and 30 DAYS TRIAL, freight paid to your town. Return if not pleased and the trial costs you nothing.\u201d\n\nAdd charm or detail later. Your first objective in tighter marketing is to communicate your value proposition quickly and well.\n\n2. Measure the data or risk losing money\n\nScientific Advertising is considered one of the first books to tout the benefits of split testing. You must test, measure, and tweak your approach based on the feedback your numbers give you.\n\nMany modern online marketers first encounter split testing through the glory of email marketing, as they use an email service provider to automatically send different subject lines of the same newsletter to a list and determine which subject gets a better engagement rate.\n\nRelated: 9 Sales and Marketing Tips for Startups\n\nBut even Mr. Hopkins\u2019 data measurement techniques of coupon redemption and tracked phone calls hold their weight today both in analog and digital forms. Google UTM parameters are key for an online entrepreneur to correctly track where their website traffic comes from, and the custom links of affiliate marketing have made it an industry seeing double-digit growth each year.\n\nThe approach is simple: test different campaigns, chop the initiatives that fall flat and do more of what works.\n\n3. Leverage human psychology\n\nWe can try to tell ourselves the world is different now and humans have different motivations than they did nearly a hundred years ago. But part of what makes Scientific Advertising so timeless is that the core principles of human psychology really haven't changed all that much.\n\nThe good news, as Mr. Hopkins notes, is that since human psychology is unchanging, once you learn these critical marketing triggers you\u2019ll never have to unlearn them.\n\nA few tactics particularly lauded in chapter six of the book include\n\nCuriosity. Unexpected and exciting details capture the heart and mind of an intrigued consumer.\n\nPrice. Mr. Hopkins highlights that no one likes cheaply made products, yet everyone likes the idea of a deal.\n\nGuarantees. The opportunity to try a product risk-free changes the psychology and defense mechanisms in a buyer\u2019s mind.\n\nSamples. Rather than desperately give out samples to everyone in sight, educate your followers first, and let them ask for a sample or to give the product a try. When the initiative is made by the prospect, psychology is in your corner.\n\nNectar uses the psychology of guarantee to great effect. When Nectar wants to sell you a mattress, they offer you a 365-day trial, more than 3 times their industry competitors. \u201cWhich of these sounds better to you, a 100-day trial or a 365-day trial?\u201d is a powerful headline rooted in psychology.\n\nRelated: Easy Simple Plan for Entrepreneurs to Create a Marketing Plan\n\nEven as photography, videography, and other forms of content production rise in popularity, these psychological triggers continue to run the show behind the scenes. Any entrepreneur looking to market or sell must employ one or more of these tactics to hook a prospect\u2019s interest.\n\n4. Tension relief outsells prevention\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that it\u2019s much easier to identify a consumer\u2019s pain and offer to remove it than it is to encourage precautionary measures. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to be all doom and gloom, but you do want to elicit tension in some way when attempting to persuade others.\n\nMany of Scientific Advertising\u2019s examples still apply today. Toothpaste ads that promise whiter teeth outperform ones that tout the continued prevention of cavities. Soaps that promise more radiant, glowing skin will always outperform a headline like \u201ckeep clean\u201d.\n\nTo move others to act now and not later, focus on trouble and how your product, program or service alleviates that trouble.\n\n5. Consumers buy complete stories\n\nA Nielsen report found that Americans spend an astonishing 11 hours and 27 minutes each day consuming media, a number that has risen year after year.\n\nThat\u2019s because stories sell, whether we\u2019re paying with our dollars or our time. Mr. Hopkins notes that it\u2019s an advertiser\u2019s job to sell a complete story or proposition within a single ad, and then let the consumer decide if they are for or against the proposition.\n\nHopkins notes that, at $10 a word (about $151/word in today\u2019s dollar), every word has to be a \u201csuper-salesman.\u201d It sounds like every word also has to be a \u201csuper-storyteller\u201d, and in this scenario, your value proposition is the story.\n\nMastering marketing\n\nNo matter your industry of expertise, it\u2019s a valuable use of time to learn and master the strategies that persuade people to click or buy.\n\nWhether your dominant marketing approach is SnapChat or direct mail, the principles in Scientific Advertising are timeless, proven, and a tactic you can start putting in place for free today.", "author": ["Nick Wolny"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/pWqrLEM3xcA/346179", "published": "2020-02-10T22:19:00", "title": "Top 6 Marketing Money Wasters", "text": "Avoid these common but costly mistakes to save yourself headaches and cash.\n\nFebruary 10, 2020 9 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nRecently, I got a call from a small business owner who was wondering when all the money he was spending on marketing would show returns. His company was running Google AdWords and Facebook ads, they were active on social media, they\u2019d paid a website company to run their website and do their SEO.\n\nI asked him how long he\u2019d been executing his strategy. \u201cSix months,\u201d he told me. My jaw dropped to the floor. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d I said. This guy has flushed over $50,000 down the toilet with nothing to show for it.\n\nStories like this just break my heart because small business owners have such a low margin of error. All the money they spend is the money from their own pocket. Money that they would otherwise use for themselves, for their family, for their lives. But they waste it on marketing because they don\u2019t understand how it really works.\n\nThat stops now. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned over the years are the biggest marketing money wasters and what you can do to avoid them.\n\nMoney Waster #1: Starting with Logos and Branding\n\nI had a client once who was starting a 3PL shipping company. He came into my office all excited one day saying, \u201cI was listening to Mozart, and I realized shipping is a lot like Mozart\u2019s music so I\u2019m going to name the company Mozart Shipping.\u201d\n\nI told him nicely that I appreciated his passion, but he was running a shipping company. His customers wanted to know their items were secure and safe. They weren\u2019t hiring him to ship musical instruments.\n\nMany small business owners think creating a clever logo and branding is their first order of business. Their reasoning: \u201cWithout that logo, I don\u2019t have a business.\u201d So they spend a whole bunch of money hiring someone to help them do this. But nine times out of 10, this strategy doesn\u2019t work. As their business grows and changes, so must their logo and branding. They end up having to keep paying someone to redo it multiple times.\n\nThe first thing a business owner needs to do is figure out what\u2019s unique about your company. Second, what do the other logos in your industry look like? You want to be industry appropriate but also a little different. This way customers know what you offer, but they\u2019re also intrigued.\n\nLook at the different logos online and pick out the elements you like the best. Once you do that research, then give that brief to a designer or a design company, you\u2019ll save yourself a ton of time and money.\n\nMoney Water #2: Building a Web Site Right Away\n\nEveryone thinks, \u201cIf I build a website, they will come.\u201d It\u2019s not true. Think of a website not as the end game but as a cog in your marketing wheel. This is not 2001. No one\u2019s tripping over your website by accident. You must have a strategy that drives traffic to the website, and then from the website, you need to be taking customers somewhere\u2014on-site or off the site\u2014to close the deal.\n\nAnd your website doesn\u2019t have to be fancy with all the bells and whistles. You just need a strategically built website that helps people buy stuff.\n\nMoney Waster #3: Using A One-Size-Fits-All Social Media Strategy\n\nMany spend all this money hiring people to run their social media, but they don\u2019t get results they desire.\n\nThe reason is twofold. First, the social media experts they hire often don\u2019t necessarily get their voice. Thinks of social media as a giant party. You don\u2019t want someone else showing up to that party, wearing a \u201cyou\u201d costume, who doesn\u2019t sound or think like you. It just comes across as fake, transparent, or just plain awkward. And everyone else at the party will ignore you.\n\nIf you\u2019re hiring someone to be you at the party, then they need to really get to know you. They need to sound like you. You need to train them to have your voice.\n\nThe second reason social media strategies fail is that companies try to execute the same social media across multiple platforms\u2014Facebook. Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.\n\nAgain, if social media is a party you don\u2019t want to show up wearing a tuxedo to a little kid\u2019s birthday party or shorts to a wedding. All social media platforms have different uses and requirements. Rarely does one person know how to master each platform. When you hire someone to do social media, you need to figure out their platform superpower. It\u2019s far wiser to hire a different expert or each one. Hire more part-time people if you need to.\n\nMoney Waster #4: Blindly Placing Pay-Per-Click Ads\n\nMany business owners are lured by the simplicity of interfaces like Google Adwords and Facebook Ads. But just because they\u2019re easy to use, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to bring you sales. PPC ads are a science. For every ad, there are at least five critical moving parts, including the header language, the subtext, the imagery, and targeting. I\u2019ve worked with some of the top experts in the world, and they will babysit and tweak these ads all day to make them work well. Don\u2019t try to do PPC on your own without knowing everything about it. Hire a professional to help you or learn about it yourself via YouTube videos or paid courses.\n\nAnother money waster I see made in the PPC space is when companies drive online traffic to a non-converting online funnel. As I said in mistake #2\u2014 if your website doesn\u2019t convert, paying to drive traffic to a website that doesn\u2019t convert is like asking to flush your money down the toilet. It doesn\u2019t help.\n\nEven worse\u2014 I\u2019ve seen people try to use online advertising to drive people into a physical store. It\u2019s not going to work.\n\nMake sure that your offer is strong, that customers can get it quickly, and that you\u2019ve got follow-up strategy. You\u2019ve got to have a proper backend that converts when they click.\n\nMoney Waster #5: Siloing Sales and Marketing\n\nWhen you\u2019re a small business, you can afford to separate marketing and sales. Say your marketing gets someone in your funnel, you still need to close the deal.\n\nFact 1: 80 percent of sales are made after the fifth follow up. You read that right\u2014the fifth\n\nFact 2: Only 10 percent of salespeople ever reach out five or more times. That means that 10 percent of salespeople close 80 percent of the deals.\n\nWhat does this mean? If you don\u2019t have a good follow-up, you\u2019re losing 80 percent of your sales.\n\nMy best advice for small business owners is super simple. I call it call-email-call. If you\u2019ve got a call with someone, you follow up with an email. If you start with an email, follow up with a phone call, and then an email. Up to three communications per week is fair.\n\nAnd warn people what you\u2019re going to do. Otherwise, it can get a little weird. Let\u2019s say I meet you at an event and we hit it off, and maybe you want to buy from me, then we say goodbye and you get an email from me and then a phone call. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, stalker. Back off.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s say at the end of the event, I ask, \u201cDo you want me to send you a follow-up email tomorrow with some more information?\u201d You say, yes. So I send you that email because I warned you; I fulfilled my promise. At the end of that email, I write: \u201cI\u2019m going to call you in the next few days to see if you have any questions.\u201d Then I call you. Am I still stalker, or am I professional?\n\nMoney Waster #6: Not Knowing When to Quit\n\nBefore you spend any money on marketing, you need to do a breakeven analysis. Think through what it\u2019s going to cost you to run this marketing endeavor from the cost of any assets you need, companies you might hire, time spent \u2014all of your expenses\n\nThen estimate what income you will bring in and how much money you\u2019ll earn from each customer. If you don\u2019t know this, you shouldn\u2019t spend any money to start with.\n\nNext, do some calculations. If you\u2019re running a $10,000 ad campaign and you sell something that\u2019s $4.95 with a 10 percent profit margin, you need a whole lot of people to buy that thing to make it worth it. But if you\u2019re running a $2,000 ad campaign and you sell services at $300 an hour, and your average client works with you for 5 hours at a minimum, you\u2019re pretty close before you get out the door.\n\nAssume that it takes five to seven touchpoints to go from cold to sold. Look at each interaction as part of that framework. If you cannot afford, in any marketing endeavor, between five and seven touchpoints, you can\u2019t do it. Say you\u2019re doing postcard mailing. If you don\u2019t have some kind of flow built in here that has those touchpoints, it\u2019s not enough to convert.\n\nA big part of not wasting money on marketing is thinking it through beforehand. Ask yourself: Are you touching people enough to convert them? Do you have the financial bandwidth to get them all the way through to the end, and will you earn enough at the end of it?\n\nAnd if it\u2019s not earning, stop now. Don\u2019t try harder; try different.", "author": ["Estie Rand"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/c4CXy5XBi_w/346039", "published": "2020-02-10T13:30:00", "title": "Become an SEO Expert and Make Your Business Stand Out Online", "text": "Save on those huge SEO fees by doing the hard work yourself.\n\nFebruary 10, 2020 2 min read\n\nDisclosure: Our goal is to feature products and services that we think you'll find interesting and useful.

You see, I am trying to sign up my daughter for dance classes. Four of them. She loves dance, has been on company teams before and is ready to go \u201call in\u201d (i.e. they're about to get a payday from me over and over again). The problem is, I can\u2019t get the dance studio to take my money.\n\nI\u2019ve tried emailing, calling, showing up in person only to find it closed, showing up in person when they are open. None of it has worked so far. The latest exchange involved the owner telling me to use a different email address because the one that I used requires him to log in, and he always has trouble doing it. This was in response to my last message that asked for us to sign her up. Seriously.\n\nIf the school wasn\u2019t so close to our house and I hadn\u2019t heard such great things about their program, I would have given up a long time ago. As I am sure many have. Can you imagine how much they have lost in sales?\n\nSo the question is: Is this happening inside of your business, too? Before you're quick to say no, ask yourself: Was there ever a question that came into our website that took me a minute to respond to? Did I ever miss someone contacting us on social media? Was there a voicemail that got lost somewhere? Does my team always capture every lead?\n\nI know that at Powerful Professionals Business Coaching, we occasionally mess this up for sure. And when we do, it hits that pit in my stomach normally reserved for roller coasters and grownups wearing clogs.\n\nRelated: The 1 Secret You Need to Know to Increase Sales\n\nTo elminate the need for such a moment of angst, I browse the inquiries that come into our customer service team a few times a week, and we\u2019ve built time into our planning to comb through all channels to make sure everyone is answered. We even hired a VA whose only job is to monitor and reply to my social media messages and comments so we don\u2019t miss anything any longer.

This not only makes it more difficult for real influencers, but also causes marketers to be more cautious when thinking about trying to use them.\n\nRelated: 'Influencer Fraud' Costs Companies Millions of Dollars. An AI-Powered Tool Can Now Show Who Paid to Boost Their Engagement.\n\nAs a brand, you don\u2019t want to associate yourself with fake influencers, nor do you want to waste your money on them. You need to know how to look properly for real influencers and how to identify fake ones from the herd. Luckily, the best way to spot these fake influencers is fairly simple \u2014 so long as you know what to look for.\n\nSo what is a fake influencer?\n\nThey are often bots or real people who purchase their likes and followers to help raise their engagement artificially, making them appear to have a strong following and thus a good influence over the market. That's not the reality, though, and you\u2019d get better results by opening your window and throwing your cash out into the street.\n\nHow do you spot a fake?\n\nThe simplest way to spot a fake influencer is to go into their follower list and glance at the accounts. Look out for profiles without an image as their display photo, few to no followers and/or following, no posts and also private accounts. Another marker is if followers have clearly made up names, particularly if their handles contain lots of numbers. If there are a lot of these accounts then it is quite likely these are bots that have been bought. The same can be done for likes and comments too.\n\nFollower to engagement ratio\n\nDo they have 10,000 followers but are only getting a few likes on their photos? Then it\u2019s likely that they have bought followers to make them appear more popular. This is surprisingly inexpensive: Buzzoid, an \"influence\" booster business, offers 5,000 \u201cquality\u201d followers for $39.99. Perhaps they have 10,000 followers and 1,000 likes, but only a few comments? This is also an indicator that they have bought both their followers and likes. A legitimate account with this many followers should be getting at least a few hundred comments on posts if they have real followers that are actually engaging with them. But that\u2019s not all \u2014 comments can also be bought if this individual is sparing no expense to make themselves look legitimate. How to spot a fake? Simple. Look for simple emoji responses or generic comments like \"Awesome!\" and \"Love it!\"\n\nRelated: Are Influencers Worth Your Money? We Went Undercover to Find Out.\n\nScreening process\n\nOne of the best ways to determine if an influencer is right for your marketing is by asking for screenshots of their audience insights. Those provide you with their followers' top five locations (cities and countries), age range and gender. This information can be a valuable tool for determining if they will be influencing the same demographics that align with your marketing. Remeber also that it's not just size that matters, trends show that 2020 will see an increase of nano-influencers as they have a more authentic connection to a highly-committed audience.\n\nAsk for references\n\nHaving someone market for you is no different from hiring a new employee. Go through similar processes, such as asking for references from previous brands, companies and businesses they have worked with. Don\u2019t be sucked in by big numbers and empty promises. Make sure you have proof first and that they are actually able to deliver before sending them anything. There is no harm in asking what the ROIs were for those collaborations \u2014 and the evidence to back it up.\n\nInsights and statistics\n\nA real influencer more than likely has a business account, which allows them to view their reach, impressions and other statistics so they can monitor how well their posts are doing. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for their latest engagement statistics in the form of a screenshot for both their account and their latest posts. If someone has thousands of followers but a true reach of a lot less, this is another red flag and should be looked into before you hire them. Engagement rate benchmarks vary by age, industry and follower size but generally fall in the 4 percent to 8 percent range.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nMost business decisions boil down to hard-headed analysis of a proposition. All the usual caveats apply, not least one of the oldest: if it looks too good to be true, it probably is. So you have to scrutinise exactly what you\u2019re getting for what you\u2019re prepared to spend.\n\nIf you do fall prey to a fake influencer and invest in them to promote and market your products, then you\u2019re unlikely to see a rise in your actual sales, which is the bottom-line metric for measuring your ROI. These basic checks will save you a lot of time \u2014 and money.\n\nRelated: 11 Common Mistakes You're Making With Influencer Marketing", "author": ["Lee Scarratt"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/d6flsLM6-tI/345804", "published": "2020-02-05T18:00:00", "title": "How to Remain Competitive in a Saturated Online Retail Market", "text": "Strategies for staying ahead amid a dizzying e-commerce landscape.\n\nFebruary 5, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nOnline retail has always been a crowded market, and thanks to the plethora of free website builders, it\u2019s more competitive than ever before. If you\u2019re entering a niche that already has a dozen entities fighting for dominance, you\u2019re going to get lost in the white noise. And even if you don\u2019t have much direct competition, there\u2019s always the threat of generalized juggernauts like Amazon to worry about.\n\nSo, what steps can you take to stay competitive in a saturated online retail market?\n\nTarget a Distinct Niche\n\nYour best bet is to try to avoid competition by targeting a distinctive niche. There are thousands of online retailers focusing on clothing, but if you focus on a specific type of item, like wool coats, you\u2019ll instantly narrow the field. Customers who are passionate about wool coats specifically will go out of their way to find a specialist.\n\nRelated: Why Digital Marketers Should Be More Like Personal Shoppers\n\nThis is also helpful if you\u2019re making use of search engine optimization (SEO). In SEO, your goal is to increase your webpages\u2019s rankings in search-engine results, but if you\u2019re competing with brands that have been building their online presence for years, you\u2019ll find it hard to penetrate powerful keywords like \u201conline apparel.\u201d Instead, you can target long-tail phrases, which come with less traffic but are much easier to rank for.\n\nLower Prices (If You Can)\n\nThis is an obvious tip, but try to lower your prices if you can, at least initially, to generate more traffic and paying customers. People often conduct price comparisons on the items they need, so if yours are the most appealing on the market, they\u2019ll flock to you.\n\nThat said, most small online retail businesses can\u2019t compete with major players on price without cutting into their profits, so you may need to find an alternative option.\n\nGive Customers Something Your Competitors Can\u2019t\n\nFor some companies, this could mean offering amazing customer service. For example, the online shoe brand Zappos became popular in part because of its unparalleled commitment to making customers happy. For other companies, it means capitalizing on an existing legacy. For example, Diamondere has been designing custom jewelry for 125 years and uses that experience in combination with modern technology to produce unique pieces unlike anything their competitors sell.\n\nStart Local\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to generate momentum for your business, you could focus on a specific local market and expand from there. Depending on the nature of your business, that might mean opening a brick-and-mortar retail location, or simply mean optimizing your site with local-specific keywords. Targeting a local audience will instantly narrow your demographics, giving you more power to tailor your products and services to their needs. More importantly, it will greatly reduce the number of companies directly competing with you. Once you start seeing growth, you can expand to target other areas.\n\nGet Customers to Try You\n\nIf you have good products at good prices and quality service to match, the only thing stopping customers from shopping with you will be familiarity. They\u2019re probably used to shopping with a bigger, more established retail brand and won\u2019t go out of their way to try something new. That\u2019s why you need to make the effort to get customers to try you. Distribute free samples, reach out to people in your target demographics, and offer amazing deals to get people started. Consider it your foot-in-the-door.\n\nRetail: These 2 Graphs Explain the Retail 'Apocalypse'\n\nLeverage Your Competition\n\nIf you can\u2019t beat a competitor, find a way to use them in your favor. For example, some ambitious online retail brands have taken to buying pay-per-click (PPC) ads that utilize their top competitor\u2019s brand name; that way, you can capitalize on customers specifically searching for your competitor and persuade them to visit your online store instead.\n\nOffer Unparalleled Customer Service\n\nYou can make up for a number of potential shortcomings, including online presence, customer familiarity and price, by offering unparalleled customer service. Anytime a customer has an issue, do everything in your power to make it right, even if it means taking a short-term loss.\n\nProvide your customers with surprise \u201cextras,\u201d like free samples or bonus products in their shipments. Make sure they\u2019re absolutely satisfied with every purchase. If you go above and beyond, you\u2019ll build a loyalty that\u2019s practically unbreakable.\n\nCompeting with well-established powerhouses in your own online retail niche may be challenging, but it\u2019s not impossible. If you\u2019re not afraid to make adjustments to your business, and if you offer something your competitors can\u2019t match, you should have a good chance of rising to prominence. Just make sure you\u2019re doing everything with your customers\u2019s interests in mind.", "author": ["Anna Johansson"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/J1_qh__05YE/345857", "published": "2020-02-05T14:00:00", "title": "Meet the CRM That's Helping More Small Businesses Scale", "text": "As more businesses goes mobile, amoCRM gives you tools to communicate more efficiently.\n\nFebruary 5, 2020 3 min read\n\nDisclosure: Our goal is to feature products and services that we think you'll find interesting and useful.

But, even being the best closer in the world won't do you any good if you're letting your leads slip through the cracks.

This customer relationship manager (CRM) centralizes all of your communications into a single unified lead profile, enabling you to stay on top of your past communications and keep conversations going without switching apps.\n\nIn practice, this means you can chat with leads on messenger apps (as well as calls and emails) within their profile.

Where other CRMs get stuck on phone and email communications, amoCRM helps businesses supply leads with instant answers and the ability to pick up and leave off whenever they want. That leads to quicker decisions and faster results.\n\nWith amoCRM, the whole team can easily see which chats they are responsible for, plus you can get team-wide access without having to share logins and passwords with everyone. cutting out extra steps that would otherwise slow you down.\n\nAs if wrangling all of your messaging isn't already a huge boon, amoCRM also gives you access to AI chatbots that you can create and customize with zero coding know-how.

Here's his advice on sales, storytelling and crafting the perfect elevator pitch.\n\nFebruary 4, 2020 10 min read\n\nThe video was terrible, and Skyler Scarlett knew it.\n\nIt was winter 2015, and he and his sister Brittney had set up a camera in their 700-square-foot cryotherapy spa in Carmel, Calif. The goal: Film a standout audition video for the next season of Shark Tank to get their company, Glac\u00e9 Cryotherapy, in front of investors. They\u2019d done a couple of takes, but Scarlett and his sister seemed wooden: They were nervous, lacked energy and weren\u2019t showcasing their personalities in the least.\n\nScarlett knew they needed to forget about the camera, so he banked on a time-honored remedy: wine and pizza. The pair decamped to the restaurant next door, ordered some Pinot Noir and then got back to work. This time, they were full of energy, having fun, improvising \u2014 Scarlett even jumped out of the nitrogen cryosauna like a jack-in-the-box.\n\nThe audition video set them apart from the competition, and a few months later, Scarlett and his sister were standing in front of the sharks. It was a game changer. When they went on the show their club had about 30 members, and two days after the episode aired, a major health club chain reached out about a potential partnership. The two moved to Mountain View, changed their business model and, six months after that, the spa had 200 monthly members. One investment firm even told Scarlett that with a single 423-square-foot location, he was making more revenue per square foot than Orangetheory Fitness.\n\n\u201cIf we had sent that first [video], we never would have been on the show,\u201d says Scarlett. \u201cMy life would be completely different.\u201d\n\nScarlett co-founded Glac\u00e9 Cryotherapy with his sister at 23 years old, when the health and wellness trend \u2014 which involves exposing the body to near-freezing or freezing temperatures for short durations \u2014 was just taking off. They had no business experience and launched their first location with $5,000.\n\n\u201cIt looked like a garage,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe had a piece of plastic, and we were trying to sell people on getting really cold and to pay us for it.\u201d\n\nIn a Shark Tank episode that aired last month, Scarlett earned himself another \u201csecond take\u201d in that he returned to the show under different circumstances. An entrepreneur with a cold-weather clothing company, Fortress, needed a way to test his product in front of the investors. Since producers \u201ccouldn\u2019t exactly bring a frozen lake out to the Shark Tank set,\u201d says Scarlett, they asked if he could come back with his cryochamber in tow. He did just that, and although Scarlett wasn\u2019t able to pitch his company again, the experience has led to additional partnership opportunities.\n\nImage Credit: ABC\n\nEntrepreneur spoke with Scarlett about his top strategies for \u201cselling\u201d your company \u2014 to both customers and investors.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the advice you\u2019d give to entrepreneurs who aren\u2019t necessarily going into a VC meeting or pitching to Shark Tank but who are carrying on conversations with influential people. What\u2019s your top tip for effectively \u201cselling\u201d your company to anyone you\u2019re speaking with?\n\nAs far as telling the story that gets them interested, I think you have to balance hype with being realistic. Everybody thinks their service or invention is the greatest thing ever, so you really have to be able to show them how you\u2019ll get from A to B to C \u2014 and how you personally, in your role, are going to get the business there. People do want to invest in people they like. They want to invest in people they believe in. It\u2019s the idea of whether you\u2019re betting on the horse or the jockey. It\u2019s kind of both, right? Who\u2019s on that horse? Sometimes you have these great ideas, but if you look at the team and they don\u2019t know how to execute, it\u2019s not going to go anywhere. That\u2019s why investors really do care about what you\u2019ve done. And if you're first starting out, you may not have done a whole lot, but you can explain why you're the right person to do it. That's what it's really all about.\n\nWhat about advice when you\u2019re in the room pitching to investors, an incubator or even a TV show? I know the preliminary process for Shark Tank likely involved both phone screenings and in-person meetings. What\u2019s the number-one piece of advice you\u2019d give, based on your own experience, when it comes to cinching that kind of opportunity?\n\nIn my experience dealing with investors, it\u2019s very important to know all your numbers. You'd be surprised how many people I\u2019ve talked to who are doing really well and don\u2019t think they need to know their numbers, or the opposite \u2014 they\u2019re forgetting the difference between revenue and profit. Investors usually want to deal with people who have a clear understanding of all the numbers that go into the business. If you want to explain why something will work, you need to be able to explain things like the conversion rate. Every entrepreneur thinks their company is the next billion-dollar company, but where are the numbers to suggest your claim is true? The market never lies. A lot of the time, it\u2019s a numbers game \u2014 you can just look at the numbers and find patterns.\n\nOver the past six-and-a-half years, what was the toughest period when it came to building your business?\n\nBecause everything was working out in the beginning, I think I became a true entrepreneur when things started not working. I feel like I had two and a half years after Shark Tank where nothing was going my way. Everything was breaking the wrong way. We\u2019d be talking to these investment groups, spending six months with them trying to line up investment money, and then they would just drop out at the last second. So being able to adapt is important. Also, we always assumed we\u2019d be up and running within three months, but it took nine months. Now I believe it\u2019s important to keep in mind that reaching a goal usually takes twice as long as you\u2019d think.\n\nTell me about the biggest mistake you made while growing your company.\n\nWhen you try to grow something small into something huge, it changes everything. For example, my sister and I were a two-person team trying to be this huge company. I was creating the website, we were both in the location selling, we were handling every aspect of the business. Eventually you need to start handing those things off and create that infrastructure if you want to scale correctly. Looking back, I wish I'd found someone that had experience growing and scaling a company. We made so many mistakes that are now obvious, but we had no idea. I don't want to beat myself up about it because we just didn't know. But if you're just starting now and trying to scale a company, if you can find a business mentor, someone that\u2019s done it, that\u2019s invaluable.\n\nEntrepreneurship journeys are often long and arduous. When you\u2019re summarizing your experience, it can be difficult to trim the fat and focus on the most engaging through-line of the story, especially since you usually have a limited time to speak. How should an entrepreneur decide which parts of their story to include in their \u201celevator pitch\u201d?\n\nThat's a great question. I think that the most valuable thing anyone can learn if they want to open a business, or be an entrepreneur, is psychology. Once you learn about psychology and human nature, it almost feels unfair. For example, I sell things that I love and use, but at times, when someone walks into my business, I know within two seconds if they\u2019re going to buy or not. And on the phone, I can read someone and see if they're paying attention or losing interest. Once you know what to look for, you can basically sell anything.\n\nAnd what\u2019s your advice for learning about psychology? How did you do it, and how can others take advantage of that approach?\n\nI've been interacting with people in this way for six and a half years. So when I'm trying to sell to someone who doesn't know me, I need to try to sell them on the point that they can trust me enough to take off their clothes and get into a chamber that\u2019s going to have negative-200 degrees of nitrogen \u2014 really? That\u2019s probably one of the craziest, most insane things in the world you could sell. I laugh about it, like if I can sell this, I can sell anything. So I really learned how to figure out what the person wants. You cannot sell someone something they don\u2019t want. If they want something else, you really need to identify what they are in fact looking for. It\u2019s also important to make it clear you\u2019re not just a car salesman \u2014 don\u2019t push sales on people, be realistic about what they can expect, make sure they feel comfortable buying.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten good at reading people when they walk in, finding out what they\u2019re looking for, understanding their objections. There will always be some objections \u2014 it\u2019s human nature \u2014 and they\u2019re all going to be very similar. I see them all the time, so it\u2019s about knowing how to respond to those objections. It works every time. Even negative selling: I had someone come in the other week who lives in New York, and I told them I didn\u2019t think it made sense to start doing treatments right then, that they should look into doing it back home in New York. And they bought a membership to join here for a couple of days since they loved my honesty. That\u2019s just reading the room and not trying to sell them on something that doesn\u2019t make sense to them. I think a lot of people go too far instead of being present with the person you\u2019re trying to sell to.", "author": ["Hayden Field"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/S6IvEUr8aU8/345780", "published": "2020-02-01T18:30:00", "title": "Don't Lose Your Brand's Mojo", "text": "This CEO and president talks about how his dislike for playing by the rules helped him embrace his entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nFebruary 1, 2020 1 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nCremo Company CEO and President of Matt Biggins shares some of the lessons he learned about working for a multinational corporation and some of his best strategies for growing a brand.\n\nBiggins and The Playbook David Meltzer chat about topics such as how to weigh personal and company values versus a potential exit, the right way to treat vendors and suppliers and why something as small as pronunciation can have a big impact on branding.

Companies have huge opportunities to attract and engage consumers, yet they face just as many challenges. Building a community around a brand serves both objectives: drawing people in and giving them a reason to stay.\n\nNot that it\u2019s easy. Organically connecting consumers takes more than a token effort, and it has to be a long-term commitment. Here are some strategies other brands have used successfully.\n\n1. Create a mission that helps the larger community\n\nPeople are drawn to communities that reflect their values and principles. That means brands can\u2019t just focus on what they sell; they also need to establish what they stand for. Popular brands TOMS and Bombas donate a pair of shoes or socks, respectively, for every pair sold. They\u2019re about more than just footwear, a stance that appeals to many consumers and unites them around shared values.\n\nUse a clear and concise mission statement to define what your brand believes in and how it strives to better the world. Then, build those values into the core of what you do. For example, The Giving Keys, a Los Angeles-based jewelry company, proactively employs people transitioning out of homelessness. Not surprisingly, consumers who share the mission of fighting homelessness gravitate toward this brand before others. It doesn\u2019t matter what your mission is, as long as it\u2019s meaningful and the commitment is genuine.\n\n2. Build a space for community connections\n\nCommunities need a space to grow, and you need a place where you can engage directly with the community members to create deeper connections. There are plenty of existing opportunities for this on social media, such as creating a Facebook group for your community, but you can create your own platform if you crave more input into the overall look, feel and direction of your brand community.\n\nLEGO recognized this opportunity when it built LEGO Ideas, an online community for people to show off what they build with its multi-hued plastic blocks. By putting its own iconic name on the community, LEGO unified the entire enthusiast population of builders. These spaces can also serve the uninitiated. Made, a UK-based furniture company, uses its Unboxed platform to collect pictures of its pieces in people\u2019s homes, which helps potential buyers understand more about its products.\n\n3. Let the community drive the brand\n\nCommunities involve communication and collaboration among equals, not top-down directives. \u201cToday, brand-building is not primarily through one-way communication via advertising,\u201d explains Ray Li, CEO of custom-made clothing company Sene, in an interview for American Express's blog. \u201cThe new way is co-creation, enabling customers to build your brand with you.\u201d Brands can demonstrate that by incorporating community feedback into future products or social initiatives. More than just listening, however, brands need to relinquish a certain amount of control to the community itself.\n\nThe TED Talk lecture series did this when it introduced TEDx in 2009, giving individuals the ability to organize their own lectures under the marquee brand name. Live-streaming company Twitch goes a step further and invites popular streamers to the company\u2019s headquarters to have a direct dialogue. The lesson? Always treat community members like participants rather than audience members.\n\nRelated: 7 Mission Statements That Inspire You to Buy\n\nDon\u2019t expect communities to evolve overnight. Instead, work to build them organically and incrementally. That may take longer and require more creative thinking, but the community that results could easily become your single biggest asset.", "author": ["Tiffany Delmore"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/W-6mfNz3Ik0/345700", "published": "2020-01-31T16:00:00", "title": "Copywriters Use These 4 Psychological Tactics to Write Attention-Grabbing Headlines", "text": "Leverage psychology in your copywriting to increase your powers of persuasion.\n\nJanuary 31, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nMany content marketers feel a headline can be as important, if not more important, than the content itself. In fact, a study found that 59 percent of articles shared on social media weren\u2019t even clicked on by the user in the first place.\n\nWhether your end goal is to educate, pitch, or sell, headlines are a critical component in your online marketing efforts, and readers use headlines to make a snap judgment about your content.\n\nAnd the notion that people don\u2019t have time to read is a fallacy. Research has shown that when we\u2019re curious, we\u2019re more likely to expend precious resources such as time to find out the answer.\n\nThe good news is that you don\u2019t have to be a wordsmith or a literary genius to write great headlines. An effective headline isn\u2019t about the words, but rather the brain science in play when someone pauses to read.\n\nRelated: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Writing a Book\n\nWhen zinged by a great headline, readers will drop everything to consume. The job of a headline, and your overall copy, is to deliver an emotional charge that suspends logic and creates psychological tension that can only be relieved with a click.\n\nAs a content writer and copywriter pitching editors and driving web traffic day in and day out, I see firsthand what works and what doesn\u2019t. I can say with confidence that when you improve content headlines in your online business, the needle will move.\n\nHere are four techniques that will make your next headline more persuasive.\n\n1. Leverage urgency and scarcity\n\nTo win the click or the sale, you must not only answer the reader\u2019s question of \u201cWhy this?\u201d, but also \u201cWhy this now?\u201d. Copywriters thread urgency and scarcity into a headline to elicit fast action.\n\nUrgency creates a psychological experience in which we feel we must consume the information or product now, not later. The secret sauce of urgency is that it causes the emotional part of your brain, the amygdala, to activate and temporarily outrun your systems of information processing, housed in your frontal lobe.\n\nRelated: The 5 Skills You Need to Become a Successful Content Writer\n\nPsychologist Daniel Goleman coined the term \u201camygdala hijack\u201d to describe this sometimes-irrational fear response; we want this in copy because it means emotion has taken over.\n\nReader validation is one common way to achieve this emotion. In this technique, we tap into the reader\u2019s fear of being an impostor or not belonging. The example headline \u201c9 Truths About Morning Productivity Only Successful People Know\u201d encourages you to click and read if you perceive yourself as a successful person and crave validation of that self-perception.\n\nPassage of time is another effective urgency trigger that preys on the pain of being held back. Will the prospective reader fall behind in their career or life if they don\u2019t click? \u201cLast workshop of 2019 closes this Friday\u201d elicits pain if the reader could benefit from attending the workshop now rather than later.\n\nScarcity refers to the number that are still available. It creates speed in a different way \u2014 in this case, your thought process gets disrupted by the realization that what you want is almost gone.\n\nScarcity technically falls under the umbrella of urgency. A good way to delineate the two is that scarcity usually highlights limited supply; even if you were to act within the given time window, you may still miss out.\n\n\u201c7 spots left and they\u2019re going fast - you in?\u201d is a dead-simple email newsletter subject line packed with scarcity and speed. If you don\u2019t act right now, you risk missing out on the opportunity.\n\nScarcity doesn\u2019t always have to be supply-related. Last-chance language can stir up similar emotions \u2014 \u201cLast day for purchases to arrive by Christmas\u201d is an effective headline for product-backed businesses or disappearing bonuses.\n\nBe cautious about using fake urgency and scarcity. If you say the added bonus expires on Friday, then continue to promote it again and again, you risk eroding confidence and trust in your brand.\n\n2. Get specific\n\nSpecificity creates a more vivid experience in the brain. The more real a headline feels to someone, the more likely they are to engage with your content.\n\nRelated: Balancing Creativity and SEO in Content Writing\n\nNumbers create specificity and engage the brain, especially when represented as a digit rather than a word (\u201c5\u201d instead of \u201cfive\u201d).\n\nNumbers also help to outline the upcoming content, which saves your brain from having to enlist the logical part of your mind; as a result, your emotional brain continues to run the show.\n\nResearch from Conductor also found that 36 percent of respondents prefer a number in the headline; numbers provide more detail in a compact way.\n\nDescriptive adjectives also light up the reader\u2019s brain and increasing the overall synaptic activity happening in the reader\u2019s mind.\n\nAdjectives can help to assert the desired end result. The headline I used for this article described \u201cattention-grabbing headlines\u201d to draw in the entrepreneur who has conversion marketing, clicks, and transactions on their mind.\n\n3. Drum up curiosity\n\nAn analysis by BuzzSumo of 100 million headlines showed that, when it comes to traffic and click-through, curiosity is king.\n\nIn our brains, curiosity is part of a reward pathway. We seek new ideas or information because it sometimes leads to a reward. (This is why reader validation works; even when the information ends up not being new, self-validation ignites our brain\u2019s reward systems.)\n\nResearch also implies that our brains assign more dopamine to the learning of information we didn\u2019t previously know.\n\nDr. Todd Kashdan, a lifelong researcher on curiosity, notes in a study that there are different flavors of curiosity and different sensitivities to each from person to person.\n\nFor some readers, dangling a puzzle to solve will get the click, while for others a more effective trigger to pull back the curtain and reveal how a certain group of people approach a topic.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways Your Business Will Benefit From You Writing a Book\n\nThe latter approach was leveraged in the headline of this article--you want to know what copywriters take into consideration when crafting headlines.\n\n4. Be clear and concise\n\nThe optimal subject line and headline length is a hot topic, and three conflicting reports are often cited.\n\nOutbrain researched that headlines that are 16-18 words in length tend to outperform ones that are shorter or longer.\n\nSocial media company Buffer, however, says an ideal headline is six words, and also backs up their claim with research.\n\nAnd an analysis done by Mailchimp of their millions of users found that headline length didn\u2019t impact the open rate at all.\n\nWhich is correct? A good exercise for any entrepreneur is to practice getting the point across in as few words as possible to start. For experts or seasoned professionals, this brevity can be a workout.\n\nWhen you develop this skeletal headline style, you learn to pack more punch into each word. Explore 3-5 headlines that get the point across quickly, then go back over your headline options and add detail or adjectives only if they elicit more emotion from the reader.\n\nHelping your audience\n\nEven as honest, hard-working entrepreneurs, we must stir up emotion in our headlines if we want to help our audience.\n\nWhen your copy leverages our hard-wired emotional response, objections go the wayside. Use these tactics to inform and inspire your audience to take the next step now and not someday.", "author": ["Nick Wolny"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/x0eX4eRu9-k/345629", "published": "2020-01-30T20:00:00", "title": "3 Ways to Get Free Publicity and Media Mentions for Your Business", "text": "Getting media mentions builds credibility, increases your favorable exposure online and adds extra luster to your brand.\n\nJanuary 30, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nRegardless of your title, industry or territory, most of us could use more positive exposure. Getting media mentions builds credibility, increases your favorable exposure online and adds extra luster to your brand. Who wouldn\u2019t want these benefits?\n\nRelated: 4 Easy Ways to Get Publicity for Your Business\n\nFor those seeking more visibility and exposure, there are three simple, surefire ways to secure coverage that will elevate you above the competition:\n\n1. Write an article\n\nWriting an article is a great way for an entrepreneur to demonstrate expertise while also keeping in control of the message. The article topic could pertain to an industry trend or news story, share a how-to approach, or discuss a fresh perspective on a problem. Take a cue from major bestsellers and employ grandiose, attention-getting titles like Think and Grow Rich, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and The Five Love Languages \u2014 and be sure to deliver the information and insights that can help your audience. Think of your piece as a solution to a burning problem. It could also clarify a major misconception, or provide a futuristic outlook on the industry. Your article should be informative, factual, and include relevant statistics and lively examples. Conclude with takeaways for the reader.\n\nRelated: 7 Ways to Generate Publicity Without Spending a Cent\n\n2. Be an expert source\n\nBeing an expert source is a win-win: you help a journalist while also showcasing your knowledge and insights in your field, in the form of being quoted. For stories on major current events, news germane to your industry and other topics like business best practices, journalists seek sources to provide commentary to add dimension to their articles. Being a source will increase awareness of you and your company. Define what expertise you have \u2014 whether it\u2019s entrepreneurship, real estate development or debt relief \u2014 and contact relevant journalists who write about this topic to offer your comments. Always aim to be helpful, informative and never pushy. Sign yourself up as a source on expert sites like HARO (Help a Reporter Out).\n\nRelated: Positive Publicity Boosts Your Startup's Chance for Success\n\n3. Get your company featured\n\nWhether you run a corporation, small business, or solo practice, we all want to stand out against the competition as the superior option. What makes your company different could be your story, a unique aspect of your service, or a novel product. For example, I worked with a Christmas company whose owner had converted religions because he was so smitten with the Christmas holiday. Even if you don\u2019t think your background is noteworthy, most entrepreneurs have a great story to tell. Local print and online news outlets who publish resident and business profiles are a great place to start to share what's new and interesting about your firm. Have ready any memorable customer stories or cases to demonstrate the value you are bringing.\n\nImportant note: Unless you are working directly with a publication for inclusion in sponsored or native content, NEVER pay a third party or writer to be included in an editorial article. This is against most reputable publications' policies, and your mention \u2014 and money \u2014 will disappear.\n\nThe power of positive media mentions\n\nThe need for positive exposure in an increasingly saturated marketplace has never been stronger. With a little creativity and effort, you may use these tactics to spark journalist interest, earn positive media coverage and increase visibility amongst the public, prospective clients, investors and other target audiences. For those who are short on time, a public relations professional can do the heavy lifting to position you as an expert, secure top-tier opportunities on your behalf, and even create effective talking points so you know exactly what to say and do in a media interview. Building awareness of your brand and establishing yourself as an expert in the public eye is a powerful way to support business development, improve sales and ensure long-term success.", "author": ["Deborah A.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid - RC17820E6760\n\nThen Cordes discovered impact investing. \u201cWe became passionate about sustainability,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nAt first, the Cordes Foundation allocated 20% of its $10 million endowment to private equity investments aimed to make a beneficial social or environmental impact. Today, all of the foundation\u2019s assets are invested in projects that promote the family\u2019s values, including ethical fashion brands and sustainable supply chains.\n\n\u201cThere are real investing opportunities with impact. It\u2019s not about disguised philanthropy,\u201d said Cordes, who made his fortune primarily after he sold his firm AssetMark (AMK.N) in 2006.\n\nFor impact investors like Cordes, whose foundation is based in Maryland, financial gains are critical, but social returns are equally important.\n\nMore than a quarter of family foundations are now engaged in impact investing in some form, according to a 2019 Global Family Office report from UBS and Campden Research. The average wealth of the families UBS surveyed was $1.2 billion.\n\nClimate change was the top cause supported by family offices, according to UBS, with health and clean water ranking high.\n\nWith so much capital involved, family offices - which can be managed privately or within a brokerage firm - rank with pension funds and institutional investors in the impact world. They might even be more important because they have the funds as well as the flexibility to make innovative investing decisions.\n\n\u201cIf some family is into renewable energy, they don\u2019t have to ask 15 people where they can invest,\u201d said Shawn Lesser, co-founder and managing partner of Big Path Capital, an impact investing firm.\n\nThe push to make investment decisions with an impact is driven by a younger generation, but that does not mean it is exclusively a millennial pursuit.\n\nJennifer Kenning, co-founder and CEO of Align Impact, an investment management firm, said her oldest investor is 99 and she has other clients driving investments who are in their 80s. \u201cWe have investors across four generations,\u201d Kenning said.\n\nThe key for baby boomers and the generation that precedes them is to make sure everyone is speaking the same language.\n\n\u201cIf you show them they can make money, they start to see we\u2019re talking about the same thing,\u201d Kenning said.\n\nFor younger family members like Cordes (who technically is a baby boomer at 60), what is key is aligning investing with the values of the family. For Cordes, that has involved the Grassroots Business Fund and Women\u2019s World Banking, non-profits that focus on developing economies.\n\n\u201cA lot of foundations have a grant side where they give to environmental causes, but on the asset side, they are invested in big oil. Families are saying that doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said Michael Whelchel, the other co-founder and managing partner of Big Path Capital. \u201cSo they say, \u2018Let\u2019s have a double bang for our buck.\u2019 \u201c\n\nPROOF IN PERFORMANCE\n\nWant proof that impact investing can pay off? Ask the folks who put money into Beyond Meat Inc (BYND.O) through ImpactAssets, a fund that aggregates charitable investment accounts, known as donor advised funds. Beyond Meat's initial public offering in May 2019 sizzled (reut.rs/2O7QkDC).\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of attention from that, because we were an early investor, and it was such a high-flying and attention-getting IPO,\u201d said Tim Freundlich, CEO of ImpactAssets. \u201cBut it\u2019s just one piece of the evolving narrative here.\u201d\n\nImpactAssets participates in 675 private debt and equity investments, making three new deals a week, Freundlich said. In contrast, most venture funds only do about 20 deals in a year.\n\nThe fund\u2019s minimum investment is only $5,000, but most family offices are putting in $100,000 or more at a time.\n\nWith financial powerhouses like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock jumping big into sustainable investing (reut.rs/38QWC26), Align Impact's Kenning thinks the next step is for more families to come together to push a broad agenda for societal good.\n\n\u201cOur climate issues are pretty substantial.

REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThe future is not quite shaping up like that for him.\n\nDecades ago, the 69-year-old from Sylva, North Carolina took out about $130,000 in federal loans for grad school. His hopes of eventually wiping that bill clean were dashed when he lost his well-paying job in his late 50s; the debt ballooned to $170,000, and stayed with him even after he declared bankruptcy.\n\nNow semi-retired and on Social Security, \u201cthere\u2019s no way that money will be ever be repaid,\u201d Lomax said.\n\nLomax is hardly alone in his plight of being past 50 and in a deep financial hole.\n\nThe median debt for older Americans shot up 400% between 1989 and 2016, according to the Federal Reserve. But you do not often hear about it, perhaps because of emotional factors like shame and embarrassment.\n\nPaying off debt is a financial priority for 4 out of 10 retirees, according to a survey by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. That includes 29% grappling with credit-card debt, 17% still paying off a mortgage, 11% dealing with other consumer debt like medical bills or student loans, and some coping with a combination.\n\n\u201cThere has been a steady rise in the ratio of debt-to-income, indicating that older households are becoming more vulnerable to income shocks later in life,\u201d said Olivia Mitchell, a professor at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and executive director at the Pension Research Council.\n\nMitchell cited a few factors that were exacerbating the problem, and one is the run-up in housing prices in recent decades, which has made it more challenging to secure affordable mortgages.\n\nMedical expenses are another culprit.\n\nFinancial planner Jennifer Weber of Lake Success, New York cites a client who endured a back injury and multiple surgeries in his late 50s, saddling him with bills and forcing him to cut back on his work. Despite having disability insurance, he still ended up $100,000 in debt as retirement loomed.\n\nAnd a final, surprising debt factor for this advanced age group: student loans. As of 2018, Americans over 50 owed $260 billion in student loans, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nSince this type of debt typically cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, it can easily haunt you for a very long time \u2013 just as it is doing with Allen Lomax.\n\nA WAY OUT\n\nThe best advice is one that most will not want to hear: Work longer. But it is inevitable for many.\n\nOnce you call it a day on your career, you have to deal with remaining debt by drawing down your savings, making it more likely the money will eventually run out.\n\nAn added bonus of working a few more years is that the longer you delay taking Social Security, the higher your monthly payout will be.\n\nPerhaps the biggest enemy of a secure financial future is darkness and secrecy. When it comes to debt, you cannot address what you do not confront, or admit to a spouse or life partner.\n\n\u201cWe had a client whose husband racked up about $50,000 in credit-card debt without the wife\u2019s knowledge, five years before they were ready to retire,\u201d said Tess Zigo, a financial planner in Lisle, Illinois. \u201cWe discussed the different options like 401(k) loans, and they ended up working with a debt consolidation company to lower their monthly payments.\u201d\n\nAs for Allen Lomax, he does what he can. He works as an adjunct professor, raises awareness about the debt issue through organizations like Student Loan Justice, and is grateful that income-based repayment plans have prevented his situation from getting even graver.\n\nAlso, he will not pass on his debts to his heirs, because any remaining balance will get discharged upon his death.\n\n\u201cIt could have been worse if I had not stayed on top of it, and let it default altogether,\u201d Lomax said. \u201cI try to keep it out of my mind, but it constantly hangs over my head.

Several stepped in and bailed out ailing U.S. and European banks in the global financial crisis, a move that proved highly profitable for many when they later sold on their stakes. In 2012-14 as some sovereign funds from oil-rich nations shed stocks and other assets, other investors moved into equities.\n\nBut more recently those differences largely evaporated, according to a report from asset managers State Street Global Advisors.\n\nDuring 2016-18, sovereign wealth funds\u2019 allocations to private markets, such as real estate, infrastructure and private equity, grew at a slower rate than previous years and at a similar level to the global asset management industry.

Headsets can be found in a small, sparse conference room at the end of a warren of corridors in the store room.\n\nOnce you put one on, though, you are in a zen-like middle world. A few turns on a spinning office chair, and you lose all sense of the room around you.\n\nTo teach what are known as \u201csoft skills,\u201d which involve qualities like communication, teamwork and leadership, Walmart\u2019s empathy module begins from the perspective of the cashier.

You move through the back stories of why those particular people are upset:\n\nA father who is with his young son is short of money to buy baby medicine.\n\nA man is late to see his daughter\u2019s performance in a show because his car broke down, and he needs to buy jumper cables.\n\nA woman is flustered buying things her father needs because he just landed in the hospital.\n\n\u201cCashiers can get very robotic and autonomous,\u201d Trainor said. \u201cEvery single customer has a story, and there\u2019s a reason they\u2019re in the mood they are in.\u201d\n\nThe message the company is hoping to pass along: You can help make the customer\u2019s day better instead of worse.\n\nBEHIND THE TECH\n\nA lot goes into crafting the scenarios to address the biggest pain points companies face. There are scripts and storyboards, and most work with third-party content creators, like Strivr, or Talespin, based in Culver City, California.\n\nMany companies are currently using Oculus hardware, from Facebook, which comes in a few different varieties, some of which are more hands-free than others.\n\nVR technology is advancing toward systems where you can measure biofeedback and voice responses, and also track hand and eye movements, said Isabel Tewes, who leads the virtual reality enterprise ecosystem for Facebook.\n\nFidelity Investments, the Boston-based money management firm, uses many of these functions to get young call-center agents to understand their mostly older, retired clientele, said Adam Schouela, vice president of emerging technologies.\n\nThe simulation is complex.

I\u2019m not sure about that.\u201d\n\nAlphabet\u2019s shares are among a small group of stocks found in the top holdings of both mutual funds and hedge funds, two types of institutions whose investing styles tend to be markedly different, a Goldman Sachs analysis showed. That could leave it exposed to volatile price swings if sentiment suddenly changes.\n\nDespite those concerns, many investors are finding it hard to say goodbye. The 28% climb in Alphabet and the performance of other technology and tech-related stocks helped money managers post big gains in 2019, making it difficult for many to justify cutting their exposure even as they fret over the implications of its run-up.\n\nErnesto Ramos, portfolio manager of the BMO Large-Cap Growth Fund, has held onto his shares, betting that Alphabet\u2019s exposure to online advertising will eventually justify its above-average valuation. Alphabet trades at 26.6 times future earnings, compared with 18.5 for the S&P 500.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Google is seen at the high profile startups and high tech leaders gathering, Viva Tech,in Paris, France May 16, 2019.

In its latest report, the company missed analysts\u2019 estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue expectations. That news did little to dent investors\u2019 bullishness on the company: Alphabet\u2019s stock retreated briefly on the report, only to resume its climb several days later.\n\nBearish investors, however, can point to Amazon.com, which saw its market value fall below $1 trillion after its streak of record profits ended in July.

Picture taken September 30. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian/File Photo\n\nVisitors are met with a background of lush greenery, along with a banner headline: \u201cOur Commitment to Sustainable Finance.\u201d\n\nThe company recently announced a $750 billion, 10-year initiative in nine different areas such as clean energy, affordable education and accessible healthcare, and overhauled lending policies to exclude ventures like new Arctic drilling.\n\nAt first glance it might seem like the famously hard-charging Wall Street investment bank was feeling, well, not quite itself.\n\nAfter all, Goldman Sachs has not always endeared itself to critics of Wall Street. One journalist, Matt Taibbi, famously called it the \u201cVampire Squid,\u201d with its arms \u201cwrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.\u201d\n\nSo what is going on, if even Goldman Sachs is going green?\n\nThe $750 billion commitment is earmarked for investing in, financing, and advising companies that are pursuing sustainable goals - for instance, taking steps to reduce carbon emissions. Behind Goldman Sachs\u2019 efforts is essentially one guy, John Goldstein - known as the \u201cForrest Gump\u201d of the field, since he keeps popping up at key moments - who sold his firm, Impact Capital Advisors, to Goldman in 2015.\n\n\u201cLarge companies are pushing sustainability up and down their supply chains. Governments are getting more active and engaged. You\u2019re seeing it everywhere,\u201d said Goldstein, now head of the firm\u2019s Sustainable Finance Group, which was formed last July. \u201cYou can see and feel the acceleration going on.\u201d\n\nTIPPING POINT\n\nGoldman Sachs is hardly alone when it comes to big financial institutions buying into sustainability in a serious way. Up until recently, ESG investing - managing money according to environmental, social, and governance factors - has been seen as a niche interest of investors. It is still challenging, for instance, to find ESG options within many U.S. employers\u2019 401(k) plans.\n\nBut big financial players are starting to move the needle on sustainability issues. Investment giant BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and its $7 trillion in assets just joined the Climate Action 100+ initiative, pressuring companies to act on climate issues. Citigroup Inc (C.N) is another leader in the field, as a longtime and vocal supporter of the Paris Agreement, the landmark environmental accord of 2016. The firm created its Environmental Finance Goal back in 2015, devoting $100 billion to climate change solutions in areas like clean energy, infrastructure and technology.\n\n\u201cThe climate issue is not going away, and it\u2019s only going to get worse,\u201d said Lauren Compere, managing director at Boston Common Asset Management, who authored a recent report on how the world\u2019s biggest financial firms are handling environmental issues.\n\nAs big institutions go green, it can make for strange bedfellows, like some of Goldstein\u2019s clients who were carried into the Goldman Sachs fold. Among them, a group of Midwestern nuns known as the Franciscan Sisters of Mary, a Roman Catholic group out of St. Louis.\n\nThey divested from fossil fuels before most other investors had even thought about doing so. In fact they were such early adopters of the sustainability trend that they literally had to Google someone who could help them invest in the manner they envisioned.\n\nBut the nuns seem to have found a home at Goldman Sachs, just as Goldstein did, poring over reports they are sent about the impact they are having around the world. Among their investments: A number of ESG-oriented funds, as well as direct private investments such as a solar energy provider for low-income households in Kenya.\n\nOf course, Goldman Sachs\u2019 interest in sustainability is not altruistic: It is a reflection of the fact that this is where business is headed - investing for return while not destroying our collective home. Just witness the growth in managed assets for Goldstein and his group - from $550 million when they were acquired, to $6 billion in 2016, $11 billion in 2017, $17 billion in 2018, and north of $55 billion in 2019.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Coral surrounds a small island on the Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland, near the town of Rockhampton, in Australia, November 15, 2018. REUTERS/David Gray -/File Photo\n\nGlobally, sustainable and impact investing has skyrocketed to $12 trillion as of 2018, a 38% increase in two years, according to the US SIF Foundation. And if that investment trend has made for some peculiar alliances, so be it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a place that I wouldn\u2019t have imagined was possible,\u201d said Goldstein. \u201cBut the fact that I\u2019ve been along for that ride, and I\u2019m still here, speaks for itself.\u201d\n\n(The writer is a Reuters contributor.

Such concerns are far from new, but were regarded less seriously when America\u2019s primary enemies were seen as non-state groups such as Islamic State, the Taliban and al Qaeda. Now Washington is worried about other nations \u2013 not just Iran, but Russia and China \u2013 which are seen as a much more existential threat.\n\nIt also points to a much greater trend.

According to the U.S.-based Military Times, the U.S. Marine Corps already bans troops from taking personal devices on Middle East combat deployments. The U.S. Navy says it is reconsidering its rules, while the Army says such decisions - as with the 82nd Airborne - are at the personal discretion of commanders.\n\nDecisions are inevitably compromises. Taking away devices reduces the ability of personnel not just to talk to their families, but can complicate communications and organization. But concerns are growing fast. This month, the Pentagon also demanded personnel stop using the Chinese-owned TikTok application, with other similar platforms including WhatsApp also added to some blacklists.\n\nReducing \u201ccareless talk\u201d and unnecessary radio and other emissions is hardly new. As far back as World War One, British commanders discovered telephone systems in forward trenches had often been compromised by German signallers and did everything they could to ensure the most sensitive messages were instead carried by hand or word-of-mouth. Naval vessels, military aircraft and particularly submarines have long done everything possible to mask their signatures, particularly near enemy territory. Recent years, however, have seen growing lapses, including from those who might have been expected to know better.\n\nFITNESS APP\n\nIn early 2018, data released by fitness app Strava identified assorted U.S., Russian and even Iranian secret bases in Syria where military personnel and contractors appeared to have recorded their exercise runs without realizing they would be highlighted and widely shared. The U.S. military has now gone so far as to incorporate such mistakes into training exercises, killing off an entire unit in one drill after a soldier posted a selfie photo whose geo-tagging gave away their position.\n\nAuthorities are also nervous about non-accidental release of information. This November, White House and military staff removed smartphones from reporters and presidential aides for the duration of President Donald Trump\u2019s unannounced Thanksgiving trip to Afghanistan, which appeared as much about ensuring the news did not leak as worries the phones themselves might be tracked.\n\nIn terms of the latter, the greatest threat will come when artificial intelligence and voice recognition software reach the point where phones can be used to monitor nearby conversations without use of a human analyst or translator. That may come sooner rather than later \u2013 one reason why some security experts are extremely nervous about Chinese firm Huawei being at the heart of 5G phone networks in several European countries. That may include Britain, due to make its own choice soon. This week, the head of Britain\u2019s Security Service told the Financial Times he believed that risk can be managed without barring the Chinese firm altogether. U.S. counterparts, however, are much more cautious.\n\nFor authoritarian states like China and Iran, both witnessing a major spike in often smartphone-coordinated protest and unrest, being able to access and track electronic devices \u2013 and the population at large \u2013 is seen as a priority. Most notably in Xinjiang province but also across the country, Beijing is turning China into the most sophisticated surveillance state in human history. Within its borders, China already has considerable, sometimes almost exhaustive, access to data and devices. Faster and more incisive artificial intelligence and machine learning will dramatically extend that reach.\n\nThe question for Western states will be how effectively their potential foes can repurpose that technology to gather information outside their borders. The United States and its allies have become used to being able to use whatever devices and communications they wished since the Berlin wall fell. Those days are ending fast.\n\n*** Peter Apps is a writer on international affairs, localization, conflict and other issues.

A new study from Fidelity Investments, released Tuesday, shows that by five years after a divorce, most people feel recovered from the psychological and financial blows.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. one hundred dollar notes are seen in this picture illustration taken in Seoul February 7, 2011. REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won\n\nYou can speed your recovery by taking smart preventative measures, learning from the cautionary tales of those who have gone before.\n\nAmong the biggest regrets the Fidelity study exposed, for example, is that 80% of those who were not involved in their daily finances during their marriages felt bad about it once they get divorced. Those people also took longer to recover from the financial stress of divorce, with nearly 40% of them saying they have yet to recover.\n\nAnother big woe is not being involved in long-term planning and retirement investment, of particular concern for women. While more than 80% of men and women reported being involved in daily finances, only 60% of women said they were involved in long-range planning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a learning opportunity. People don\u2019t make the same mistake twice,\u201d said Meredith Stoddard, life events experience lead at Fidelity.\n\nSo what can you do now to protect your future self - which works not just for divorce but also if you end up widowed, or simply want a more financially equal marriage?\n\nHere are three tips:\n\n1. Pay attention and get involved\n\n\u201cKnowledge is power, and you should have it from the beginning,\u201d said Emily Pollock, a partner at Kasowitz Benson Torres in New York specializing in matrimonial and family law.\n\nBoth spouses need to know basic things about family finances, no matter who handles bills or long-term investing. That means looking over tax returns, knowing about the bank accounts, keeping tabs on everyone\u2019s retirement balance and making joint decisions about big financial moves like buying a house.\n\nFidelity has a document checklist (bit.ly/2FMgzea) to help you know what to look for, piece by piece, Stoddard said.\n\n2. Communicate\n\nTalking about money is hard for a lot of people, but if you do not do it, you can get in some bad jams. Fidelity\u2019s study found that 14% of respondents reported the divorce uncovered debt they did not know about, and 10% found hidden assets. This was particularly prevalent among women who had been married for more than 21 years.\n\n\u201cMake sure you have transparency,\u201d Stoddard said. \u201cChip away at it. Use the resources available. Build a strong support network. It is less overwhelming.\u201d\n\n3. Get a pre- or post-nup\n\nA prenuptial agreement where you spell out all that you have and set up a plan for the future split of everything, should there be one, is the most protection you can get for yourself, said Carole Bass, a trusts and estates partner at Moses & Singer in New York.\n\nBut even then, people do not pay as much attention to what it says as they should, and there are a lot of unknowns, Bass added.\n\nSometimes people inherit money during the course of the marriage, or sell a business, and do not pay proper attention to the way the assets are co-mingled with shared money.\n\nPostnuptial agreements, made after a marriage takes place, can solve some of these issues as they arise. Some people employ trusts as well, to keep assets separate. But more issues may crop up as you go.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to think about marriage like it is a business relationship, but it is,\u201d Bass said. \u201cYou should start this out as far as possible, and then it\u2019s easier to have a clear head.\u201d", "author": ["Beth Pinsker", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/YldHm4Ag-A4/risk-of-pension-meltdown-grows-due-to-inaction-by-u-s-congress-idUSKBN1Z61IN", "published": "2020-01-07T13:24:03", "title": "Risk of pension meltdown grows due to inaction by U.S. Congress", "text": "CHICAGO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The window is closing on the chance to avert a pension meltdown that will slash the retirement benefits of more than a million U.S. workers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The dome of the U.S. Capitol Building is seen as the sun sets on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., July 26, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott/File Photo\n\nLawmakers in Washington have been working on ways to protect the benefits promised to participants in multiemployer pension plans, which are created under collective bargaining agreements and jointly funded by groups of employers in industries like construction, trucking, mining and food retailing.\n\nLast year, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate laid out blueprints with very different visions for solutions, and failed to reach any agreement on a way forward.\n\nCongress did slip a rescue package into the massive $1.4 trillion spending bill passed last month for one plan close to failure, sponsored by the United Mine Workers of America. (Full Story) But the House and Senate are deeply divided on how to solve the broader problem - Democrats are pushing for a package of low-interest loans to prop up the funds, while Republicans want to boost insurance premiums paid by employers, add new premiums paid by plan participants and force more conservative accounting assumptions.\n\nThe failure of lawmakers to take broader action means any solution now likely will wait until after the November 2020 elections - and that will leave precious little time to avert a very damaging outcome for people counting on pensions.\n\nAs many as 117 multiemployer pension plans covering 1.4 million participants are underfunded and sponsors have told regulators and participants that they could fail within the next 20 years, according to a report issued just before the holidays by Cheiron Inc, an actuarial consulting firm that advises multiemployer plans, public employers, nonprofit organizations and corporations.\n\nSeven plans failed in the past year when they became insolvent or terminated after all the employers withdrew. And up to 12 more plans covering 245,000 participants signaled in filings with the U.S. Department of Labor that they are likely to fail by the end of this year. The plans are sponsored by union locals covering truck drivers, bricklayers and other workers.\n\nIn the past year, the amount of total underfunding has risen 15.7% to $56.5 billion. But with action unlikely during an election year, the problem likely will now wait until 2021 or later - and it becomes more expensive and difficult to solve as more plans fail with every passing year, said Gene Kalwarski, CEO of Cheiron.\n\nCheiron\u2019s analysis notes that 44 plans expect to fail by 2025 - the year when the biggest underfunded plan - the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan - runs dry. The multiemployer fund of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which backstops the plans, would be exhausted in that year, as well. In 2025, the benefits of 639,400 workers will be at risk, Cheiron said.\n\nAn earlier attempt at reform was passed in 2014. But the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act has faced strong resistance from retiree organizations, consumer groups and some labor unions. That law lets troubled plans apply for government permission to make deep benefit cuts if they can show that the reductions would prolong plan life.\n\nDIVERGENT PLANS\n\nWhen plans go belly-up, the PBGC steps in to pay a portion of benefits. But insurance premiums - and benefit levels - are much lower for multiemployer plans than for single employer plans.\n\nThe PBGC guarantee is based on a pension for each year of service a person earns under his or her plan; the maximum guarantee is $12,870 for a worker with 30 years of service - far less than that person would receive from a solvent plan.\n\nIn July, the House of Representatives passed legislation to address the problem, built around providing low-interest loans to struggling plans. But in the Senate, several key committees issued a white paper with a very different focus than the House bill. It would boost substantially the premiums that plan sponsors pay into the system, and would add premiums paid by retirees as well, which would effectively act as a benefit cut. It also contains reforms to the discount rate assumptions plans use to project future health.\n\n\u201cRepublicans view the House bill as a bailout, and Democrats think the Senate plan would make healthy plans fail,\u201d said Kalwarski. The Republican plan \u201cwould in effect spell the end for multiemployer plans,\u201d he added. \u201cMore plans would collapse, leaving fewer plans holding the bag to pay premiums.\u201d\n\nIMPLICATIONS OF MINE WORKERS RESCUE\n\nSenate Republicans may not like the idea of low-interest loans to rescue plans, but that did not stop them from adding to the 2019 spending legislation a more outright bailout for the pensions of 96,300 participants in the United Mine Workers of America plan.\n\nThe fund is the fourth-worst funded plan in the multiemployer system, and was forecast to become insolvent in 2022 before the legislation passed. But it has a powerful political ally in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and lawmakers in other major coal-mining states.\n\nThe rescue will allow the U.S. Treasury to send up to $750 million a year to the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund. The fund, supported partly by fees paid by coal companies, already is used to pay for healthcare for retired miners and will now also be used to shore up the pension fund.\n\nThe fund offered a convenient route to rescue the Mine Workers plan - but it is a taxpayer-funded bailout nonetheless. Will that have an impact on any future debates in Congress about a broader solution for multiemployer pensions? We will have to wait to see.\n\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)", "author": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/7wGB8j-dXFA/your-money-ditch-the-resolution-do-a-year-end-review-instead-idUSKBN1Z11C2", "published": "2020-01-02T18:56:50", "title": "Your Money: Ditch the Resolution - Do a year-end review instead", "text": "NEW YORK(Reuters) - It is hardly a secret that people rarely stick to New Year\u2019s resolutions - only about 8% of people actually make it to the finish line with their goals, according to studies from the University of Scranton, in Pennsylvania.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. one hundred dollar notes are seen in this picture illustration taken in Seoul February 7, 2011.

Instead of gauzy, improbable thinking about what you might do, you face the cold, hard truth about what you actually did.\n\n\u201cWe can only manage what we measure,\u201d said Sarah Newcomb, director of behavioral science at fund research firm Morningstar. \u201cIf you\u2019re not even measuring your own spending, then basically you\u2019re just flying blind.\u201d\n\nThis is especially true for the holiday season, when money seems to exit our wallets at hyperspeed. Average holiday spending on gifts and travel was slated to exceed $1,000 apiece for 2019, according to the National Retail Federation. In fact, among those who took out holiday debt in 2018, 35% of us were still trying to pay it off this past fall, according to personal finance site NerdWallet.com.\n\n\u201cUse a big event like the end of the year as a catalyst to do something you should be doing on a regular basis,\u201d said Dan Egan, director of behavioral finance and investing at Betterment.com.\n\nIf you have not been tracking your dollars, it can seem a daunting task. A few ideas on how to figure out where all that money went in 2019 \u2013 and how to do better in 2020:\n\n* Open that annual credit-card statement\n\nIn the New Year, credit-card companies send out roundups of everything you have purchased in 2019. Typically, you might just ignore it. Don\u2019t.\n\nFor one thing, the documents are useful for tax planning, since purchases are often divided into spending categories that can help identify deductions. They are also excellent for shock value, to force yourself to see how your cash was deployed.\n\nIf an entire year of spending is too overwhelming to digest, break that survey period into something smaller, like two months, advised Egan.\n\nYou can also focus on specific pain points, like pulling up your Amazon purchase history for 2019. Shocked yet?\n\n\u201cTake an honest look at what your life is costing you,\u201d Newcomb said. \u201cIf some of those costs are frivolous and are purchases you regret, that is a valuable thing to take away.\u201d\n\n* Put fintech apps to work\n\nA typical excuse for those who do not keep track of spending: It is too complicated and confusing. But with all the fintech apps now available, that excuse does not really wash.\n\n\u201cWe encourage our clients to check their \u2018You Need A Budget\u2019 app every morning over a cup of coffee,\u201d said Brenna Baucum, a financial planner in Salem, Oregon. \u201cIt takes only one or two minutes to sort their latest transactions. Then, after 30 days, they have some handle on where their money goes. Most often, the results shock them.\u201d\n\nMint.com is a popular app and one game-changer, according to financial planner Salim Boutagy of Westport, Connecticut, is its \u201cTrends\u201d section, where you can see how your spending has shifted over the last few months or years.\n\n* Calculate the unknown\n\nIn performing an annual spending review, one thing will probably jump out at you: The sheer volume of expenses that were totally unplanned and unforeseen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all pretty good at estimating common expenses like electricity and phone and internet access,\u201d said Morningstar\u2019s Newcomb. \u201cBut we are very bad at predicting the size and frequency of exceptions.\u201d\n\nThat might mean car repair, or home improvements, or medical bills, or last-minute vacations. When you see how much of 2019\u2019s spending was a total surprise, then you can build a similar buffer into next year\u2019s budget.\n\nOnce you have done your spending X-ray for 2019, it is time to rework what Betterment\u2019s Egan calls your \u201cTop-Down Budgeting.\u201d That means setting broad guidelines \u2013 like committing to saving a specific amount every month.\n\n\u201cThe point is not to be as austere as possible and deprive yourself of all joy,\u201d Egan said. \u201cThe point is to get to a right balance.\u201d", "author": ["Chris Taylor", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/c8_TleUQf8o/how-risky-etfs-won-the-decade-and-why-they-might-not-repeat-that-performance-idUSKBN1YS0BY", "published": "2019-12-24T10:45:39", "title": "How risky ETFs won the decade - and why they might not repeat that performance", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exchange-traded funds that use leverage to offer double or triple the daily return of benchmark U.S. stock indexes rank among the 10 top-performing funds of the decade, with returns that in some cases neared 2,000%, despite warnings that they are not suitable for most investors.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A picture illustration shows U.S. 100 dollar bank notes taken in Tokyo August 2, 2011.

REUTERS/Loren Elliott/File Photo\n\nBy Mark Miller\n\nCHICAGO (Reuters) - News flash: Members of Congress managed to walk and chew gum at the same time this week.\n\nIn the midst of the impeachment furor, U.S. lawmakers advanced the first significant retirement legislation in 13 years. They included the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019 in a larger package of spending legislation headed for approval this week that will keep the federal government operating next year.\n\nThe SECURE Act will have a significant impact on the retirement landscape, and it enjoys broad bipartisan support. The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives in May, but it has been hung up since then in the Senate due to pet issues of a handful of senators. As recently as last week, Washington insiders were predicting that SECURE would be pushed into 2020.\n\nBut SECURE enjoys big-time lobbying muscle from the insurance industry, which is now getting a huge Christmas gift: a safe harbor provision in the bill that makes it much easier for employers to offer annuity products through their retirement plans.\n\nAnnuities - which provide a steady stream of income over a specified time or for life - do not sell very well, but getting them in front of 401(k) participants at the point of retirement could be a very profitable game-changer for the industry. And a legitimate case for annuities can be made for some retirees. With fewer workers expecting a traditional defined benefit pension, annuities offer a way to guarantee some amount of income in retirement, mitigating longevity risk.\n\n\u201cWhen you ask people about their key fears in retirement, the worry that they will outlive their money is always near the top of the list,\u201d said Melissa Kahn, managing director for retirement policy at State Street Global Advisors.\n\nJust 10% of plans offered in-plan annuities in 2018, according to research released by the Plan Sponsor Council of America on Wednesday. Employers usually take a cautious approach to changing their retirement plans, so adoption of in-plan annuities likely will be slow. Meanwhile, the safe harbor provision of the bill has set off alarm bells among consumer advocates who worry the language does not go far enough to protect plan participants.\n\nThe provision allows plan sponsors to rely on certifications by state insurance regulators that an insurance provider is financially sound.\n\n\u201cThe state regulators put insurance companies through very rigorous tests on all of their capital requirements,\u201d said Kahn. \u201cAnd if they have been audited within five years, they cannot meet these certification requirements.\u201d\n\nConsumer advocates urged lawmakers to limit the safe harbor to cover only simple income annuities, arguing that products such as fixed-income and variable annuities are too complex and confusing for regulators to police, and for participants to understand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason the insurance industry has been lobbying nonstop to get this bill passed - it benefits them,\u201d said Micah Hauptman, financial services counsel at the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cBut investors will end up paying the price.\u201d\n\nIMPROVING 401(k) COVERAGE\n\nSECURE includes a number of other provisions that could improve the outlook for retirement saving over the coming decade and beyond.\n\nAnd make no mistake, federal legislation of this type can make a big difference. The last important retirement legislation was the Pension Protection Act of 2006. That law ushered in some major improvements in retirement plans. One has been the widespread adoption of target date funds, which add a measure of professional investment management for investors by automatically rebalancing the mix of equities and fixed income as retirement approaches. Another is automatic enrollment of new workers, which has sharply boosted participation rates.\n\nBut 10 years after the Great Recession, improvements in retirement security have been distributed very unevenly. Wealthier households have gained, but middle-class and lower-income households are treading water or are even less well-off,\n\naccording to research by the Employee Benefit Research Institute.\n\nThe organization has a simulation model that estimates the percentage of households likely to have adequate resources to meet retirement expenses. The model - which takes into account savings, pensions, Social Security and even home equity - shows that among households aged 55-64, the top half of earners have very high odds of success in retirement (ranging from 79% to 93%). Meanwhile, the second-lowest income quartile has only 50-50 odds - and the lowest income group just 11% chance of success.\n\nMoreover, just 52% of U.S. households owned retirement accounts in 2016, according to Federal Reserve data, and the figures were much worse for black and Latino households, whose ownership rates were 33.6% and 27.8%, respectively.\n\nThe SECURE Act addresses the coverage problem by making it easier for small employers to offer retirement plans to workers by banding together in multiple-employer plans. Plans would be offered by private plan custodians; the idea is to entice employers with low costs and streamlined paperwork, and an increased tax credit to cover their setup costs.\n\n\u201cMost of the coverage gap is among smaller employers, and that is the fastest-growing segment of the business community,\u201d notes Kahn. \u201cAnd they\u2019re the ones who struggle to provide any kind of retirement plan for their employees.\u201d\n\nThe SECURE Act also includes several provisions aimed at recognizing the changing demographics of retirement - namely, that people are working and living longer. The law will lift the starting age for required minimum distributions from retirement accounts to 72 (from 70-1/2) It also repeals the age cap for traditional IRA contributions (currently 70-1/2).\n\nThe law also revises the rules for distributions from inherited IRA accounts; my colleague Beth Pinsker has more on that part of the story.

One was a relatively small two-legged meat-eating dinosaur, another was a similarly small four-legged apparently plant-eating dinosaur and the third may have been a primitive mammal.\n\n\u201cFor short time periods, the streams were flowing again, the sun was shining, the plants were growing and the animals, among them dinosaurs, were grazing and hunting,\u201d said Bordy, who led the research published in the journal PLOS ONE. \u201cThis is attested by the vertebrate footprints of both meat- and plant-eating dinosaurs, plant remains, sediment deposits of streams and lakes, to name just a few.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe properties of the sandstone allow us to tell that the tracks were deposited in seasonal streams that run during flash flood events,\u201d added Bordy, whose team also included postgraduate students Akhil Rampersadh, Miengah Abrahams and Howard Head. \u201cHot was hot back then, too.

Vaccines are regularly developed and deployed against specific viruses, but that process takes a lot of time, doesn't help everyone who needs protection, and still leaves people exposed to new outbreaks and new viruses.\n\nNow, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) have uncovered a novel potential antiviral drug target that could lead to treatments protecting against a host of infectious diseases -- creating a pan, or universal, treatment. Their work suggests that the protein Argonaute 4 (AGO4) is an \"Achilles heel\" for viruses.\n\nAGO4 is one of a family of AGO proteins. Until now, there has been little evidence of why they are important. The researchers, led by Kate L. Jeffrey, PhD, and her collaborators found that AGO4 plays a key role protecting cells against viral infections.\n\nSpecifically, this protein is uniquely antiviral in mammalian immune cells. The group studied the anti-viral effects of several Argonaute proteins, and found that only cells that were deficient in AGO4 were \"hyper-susceptible\" to viral infection. In other words, low levels of AGO4 make mammalian cells more likely to become infected.\n\nThis study was published today by Cell Reports.\n\nThe MGH researchers suggest that boosting levels of AGO4 could shore up the immune system to protect against multiple viruses. \"The goal is to understand how our immune system works so we can create treatments that work against a range of viruses, rather than just vaccines against a particular one,\" says Jeffrey.\n\nMammals have four Argonaute proteins (1-4), which act by silencing genes and which are remarkably conserved throughout multiple living things, including plants. These are RNAi and microRNA effector proteins and RNAi is the major antiviral defense strategy in plants and invertebrates. Studies of influenza infected mice have shown that AGO4-deficient animals have significantly higher levels of the virus.\n\nThe next steps are to \"determine how broad spectrum this is to any virus type,\" says Jeffrey. \"Then we need to discover how to boost AGO4 to ramp up protection against viral infections.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211164903.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T21:49:03", "title": "'Atomic dance' reveals new insights into performance of 2D materials: The findings could help lead to more stable and reliable wearables and flexible electronic devices", "text": "A team of Northwestern University materials science researchers have developed a new method to view the dynamic motion of atoms in atomically thin 2D materials. The imaging technique, which reveals the underlying cause behind the performance failure of a widely used 2D material, could help researchers develop more stable and reliable materials for future wearables and flexible electronic devices.\n\nThese 2D materials -- such as graphene and borophene -- are a class of single-layer, crystalline materials with widespread potential as semiconductors in advanced ultra-thin, flexible electronics. Yet due to their thin nature, the materials are highly sensitive to external environments, and have struggled to demonstrate long-term stability and reliability when utilized in electronic devices.\n\n\"Atomically thin 2D materials offer the potential to dramatically scale down electronic devices, making them an attractive option to power future wearable and flexible electronics,\" said Vinayak Dravid, Abraham Harris Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering.\n\nThe study, titled \"Direct Visualization of Electric Field induced Structural Dynamics in Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides,\" was published on February 11 in the journal ACS Nano. Dravid is the corresponding author on the paper. Chris Wolverton, the Jerome B. Cohen Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, also contributed to the research.\n\n\"Unfortunately, electronic devices now operate as a kind of 'black box.' Although device metrics can be measured, the motion of single atoms within the materials responsible for these properties is unknown, which greatly limits efforts to improve performance,\" added Dravid, who serves as director of the Northwestern University Atomic and Nanoscale Characterization (NUANCE) Center. The research allows a way to move past that limitation with a new understanding of the structural dynamics at play within 2D materials receiving electrical voltage.\n\nBuilding upon a previous study in which the researchers used a nanoscale imaging technique to observe failure in 2D materials caused by heat, the team used a high-resolution, atomic-scale imaging method called electron microscopy to observe the movement of atoms in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a well-studied material originally used as a dry lubricant in greases and friction materials that has recently gained interest for its electronic and optical properties. When the researchers applied an electric current to the material, they observed its highly mobile sulfur atoms move continuously to vacant areas in the crystalline material, a phenomenon they dubbed, \"atomic dance.\"\n\nThat movement, in turn, caused the MoS2's grain boundaries -- a natural defect created in the space where two crystallites within the material meet -- to separate, forming narrow channels for the current to travel through.\n\n\"As these grain boundaries separate, you are left with only a couple narrow channels, causing the density of the electrical current through these channels to increase,\" said Akshay Murthy, a PhD student in Dravid's group and the lead author on the study. \"This leads to higher power densities and higher temperatures in those regions, which ultimately leads to failure in the material.\"\n\n\"It's powerful to be able to see exactly what's happening on this scale,\" Murthy continued. \"Using traditional techniques, we could apply an electric field to a sample and see changes in the material, but we couldn't see what was causing those changes. If you don't know the cause, it's difficult to eliminate failure mechanisms or prevent the behavior going forward.\"\n\nWith this new way to study 2D materials at the atomic level, the team believes researchers could use this imaging approach to synthesize materials that are less susceptible to failure in electronic devices. In memory devices, for example, researchers could observe how regions where information is stored evolve as electric current is applied and adapt how those materials are designed for better performance.\n\nThe technique could also help improve a host of other technologies, from transistors in bioelectronics to light emitting diodes (LEDs) in consumer electronics to photovoltaic cells that comprise solar panels.\n\n\"We believe the methodology we have developed to monitor how 2D materials behave under these conditions will help researchers overcome ongoing challenges related to device stability,\" Murthy said. \"This advance brings us one step closer to moving these technologies from the lab to the marketplace.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211164859.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T21:48:59", "title": "Ancient Antarctic ice melt increased sea levels by 3+ meters -- and it could happen again", "text": "Mass melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was a major cause of high sea levels during a period known as the Last Interglacial (129,000-116,000 years ago), an international team of scientists led by UNSW's Chris Turney has found. The research was published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The extreme ice loss caused a multi-metre rise in global mean sea levels -- and it took less than 2\u00b0C of ocean warming for it to occur.\n\n\"Not only did we lose a lot of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, but this happened very early during the Last Interglacial,\" says Chris Turney, Professor in Earth and Climate Science at UNSW Sydney and lead author of the study.\n\nFine layers of ancient volcanic ash in the ice helped the team pinpoint when the mass melting took place. Alarmingly, the results indicated that most ice loss occurred within the first millennia, showing how sensitive the Antarctic is to higher temperatures.\n\n\"The melting was likely caused by less than 2\u00b0C ocean warming -- and that's something that has major implications for the future, given the ocean temperature increase and West Antarctic melting that's happening today,\" Professor Turney says.\n\nDuring the Last Interglacial, polar ocean temperatures were likely less than 2\u00b0C warmer than today, making it a useful period to study how future global warming might affect ice dynamics and sea levels.\n\n\"This study shows that we would lose most of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in a warmer world,\" says Professor Turney.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn contrast to the East Antarctic Ice Sheet -- which mostly sits on high ground -- the West Antarctic sheet rests on the seabed. It's fringed by large areas of floating ice, called ice shelves, that protect the central part of the sheet.\n\nAs warmer ocean water travels into cavities beneath the ice shelves, ice melts from below, thinning the shelves and making the central ice sheet highly vulnerable to warming ocean temperatures.\n\nGoing back in time\n\nTo undertake their research, Professor Turney and his team travelled to the Patriot Hills Blue Ice Area, a site located at the periphery of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, with support from Antarctic Logistics and Expeditions (or ALE).\n\nBlue ice areas are the perfect laboratory for scientists due to their unique topography -- they are created by fierce, high-density katabatic winds. When these winds blow over mountains, they remove the top layer of snow and erode the exposed ice. As the ice is removed, ancient ice flows up to the surface, offering an insight into the ice sheet's history.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile most Antarctic researchers drill down into the ice core to extract their samples, this team used a different method -- horizontal ice core analysis.\n\n\"Instead of drilling kilometres into the ice, we can simply walk across a blue ice area and travel back through millennia. By taking samples of ice from the surface we are able to reconstruct what happened to this precious environment in the past,\" Professor Turney says.\n\nThrough isotope measurements, the team discovered a gap in the ice sheet record immediately prior to the Last Interglacial. This period of missing ice coincides with the extreme sea level increase, suggesting rapid ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The volcanic ash, trace gas samples and ancient DNA from bacteria trapped in the ice all support this finding.\n\nLearning from the Last Interglacial\n\nIce age cycles occur approximately every 100,000 years due to subtle changes in Earth's orbit around the Sun. These ice ages are separated by warm interglacial periods. The Last Interglacial is the most recent warm period to our current interglacial period, the Holocene.\n\nWhile human contribution to global warming makes the Holocene unique, the Last Interglacial remains a useful research point to understand how the planet responds to extreme change.\n\n\"The future is heading far beyond the range of anything we've seen observed in the scientific instrumental record of the last 150 years,\" says Professor Turney. \"We have to look further into the past if we're going to manage future changes.\"\n\nDuring the Last Interglacial, global mean sea levels were between 6m and 9m higher than present day, although some scientists suspect this could have reached 11m.\n\nThe sea level rise in the Last Interglacial can't be fully explained by the Greenland Ice Sheet melt, which accounted for a 2m increase, or ocean expansion from warmer temperatures and melting mountain glaciers, which are thought to have caused less than a 1m increase.\n\n\"We now have some of the first major evidence that West Antarctica melted and drove a large part of this sea level rise,\" says Professor Turney.\n\nAn urgent need to minimise future warming\n\nThe severity of the ice loss suggests that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is highly sensitive to future ocean warming.\n\n\"The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is sitting in water, and today this water is getting warmer and warmer,\" says Professor Turney, who is also a Chief Investigator of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage (CABAH).\n\nUsing data gained from their fieldwork, the team ran model simulations to investigate how warming might affect the floating ice shelves. These shelves currently buttress the ice sheets and help slow the flow of ice off the continent.\n\nThe results suggest a 3.8m sea level rise during the first thousand years of a 2\u00b0C warmer ocean. Most of the modelled sea level rise occurred after the loss of the ice shelves, which collapsed within the first two hundred years of higher temperatures.\n\nThe researchers are concerned that persistent high sea surface temperatures would prompt the East Antarctic Ice Sheet to melt, driving global sea levels even higher.\n\n\"The positive feedbacks between a warming ocean, ice shelf collapse, and ice sheet melt suggests that the West Antarctic may be vulnerable to passing a tipping point,\" stressed Dr Zo\u00eb Thomas, co-author and ARC Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) Fellow at UNSW.\n\n\"As it reaches the tipping point, only a small increase in temperature could trigger abrupt ice sheet melt and a multi-metre rise in global sea level.\"\n\nAt present, the consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2013 report suggests that global sea level will rise between 40cm and 80cm over the next century, with Antarctica only contributing around 5cm of this.\n\nThe researchers are concerned that Antarctica's contribution could be much greater than this.\n\n\"Recent projections suggest that the Antarctic contribution may be up to ten times higher than the IPCC forecast, which is deeply worrying,\" says Professor Christopher Fogwill, co-author and Director of The Institute for Sustainable Futures at the UK University of Keele.\n\n\"Our study highlights that the Antarctic Ice Sheet may lie close to a tipping point, which once passed may commit us to rapid sea level rise for millennia to come. This underlines the urgent need to reduce and control greenhouse gas emissions that are driving warming today.\"\n\nNotably, the researchers warn that this tipping point may be closer than we think.\n\n\"The Paris Climate Agreement commits to restricting global warming to 2\u00b0C, ideally 1.5\u00b0C, this century,\" says Professor Turney.\n\n\"Our findings show that we don't want to get close to 2\u00b0C warming.\"\n\nProfessor Turney and his team hope to expand the research to confirm just how quickly the West Antarctic Ice Sheet responded to warming and which areas were first affected.\n\n\"We only tested one location, so we don't know whether it was the first sector of Antarctica that melted, or whether it melted relatively late. How these changes in Antarctica impacted the rest of the world remains a huge unknown as the planet warms into the future\" he says.\n\n\"Testing other locations will give us a better idea for the areas we really need to monitor as the planet continues to warm.\"\n\nThis work was support by Laureate and Future Fellowship and Linkage funding by the Australian Research Council.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211160514.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T21:05:14", "title": "Storm-induced sea level spikes differ in origin on US east, Gulf coasts", "text": "The U.S. East and Gulf Coasts differ in how ocean and atmospheric circulation and sea level interact to produce storm surges, and both regions will experience greater storm surges as global warming progresses, according to new research from a University of Arizona-led team.\n\nThe research is the first to compare how different parts of the Atlantic Coast might fare during storms.

Having such rich information in the model allowed the team to more accurately predict how the seas along the eastern seaboard of the U.S. would respond to storms.\n\nThe team studied the coastline from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Houston, Texas.\n\nThe researchers analyzed several simulations using the model. The control used pre-industrial conditions similar to those in the 1800s. Another simulation added more and more CO 2 into the model's atmosphere at a rate of increase similar to that observed since the mid-20th century.\n\nThe pre-industrial control simulation revealed the underlying differences driving storm surge in the two regions -- wind strength along the Gulf Coast and sea level along the East Coast.\n\nThe simulation that added CO 2 into the atmosphere year after year projected that as warming progresses, there will be fewer -- but stronger -- tropical cyclones.\n\n\"For the CO 2 experiment, we found that the elevated storm surge is influenced by different factors on the East Coast than the Gulf Coast,\" Yin said.\n\nIn addition, as CO 2 in the atmosphere increases, the model reveals that the Atlantic Ocean's Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation will slow down, exacerbating sea level rise and storm surge on the East Coast.\n\n\"AMOC transports a lot of heat northward.

Rao's team is working with Dipole Materials to explore scaling up the process.\n\nRao and her fellow researchers used four different cell lines to test the efficacy of the electrospun scaffolds: 184B5, which is normal breast tissue, as a control; MCF-7, a breast adenocarcinoma; MCF10AneoT, a premalignant cell line; and MDA-MB-231, a triple negative adenocarcinoma-metastatic, a very difficult-to-detect cancer.\n\n\"We can study why and how cancer cells metastasize,\" Rao said. \"We can understand in a true 3D system why pre-metastatic cells become metastatic, and provide tools to other researchers to study signaling pathways that change between pre-malignant and malignant cells.\"\n\nAvenues for Future Research\n\nIn addition, the research has uncovered information for another area of study: In what type of cellular environment do malignant cancer cells grow best? Rao's group discovered that the triple-negative breast cancer cells preferred honeycomb scaffolds while adenocarcinoma cells favored mesh scaffolds and premalignant cells preferred the aligned scaffolds.

How the brain does all this -- within fractions of a second -- is still largely unknown.\n\nImplants that can probe the brain at the individual neuron level are not widely available to researchers. Studying neuron activity while the body is in motion in an everyday setting is even more difficult, because monitoring devices typically involve wires connecting a study participant to a control station.\n\nResearchers at the University of Arizona, George Washington University and Northwestern University have created an ultra-small, wireless, battery-free device that uses light to record individual neurons so neuroscientists can see how the brain is working. The technology is detailed in a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\"As biomedical engineers, we are working with collaborators in neuroscience to improve tools to better understand the brain, specifically how these individual neurons -- the building blocks of the brain -- interact with each other while we move through the world around us,\" said lead study author Alex Burton, a University of Arizona biomedical engineering doctoral student and member of the Gutruf Lab.\n\nThe process first involves tinting select neurons with a dye that changes in brightness depending on activity. Then, the device shines a light on the dye, making the neurons' biochemical processes visible. The device captures the changes using a probe only slightly wider than a human hair, then processes a direct readout of the neuron's activity and transmits the information wirelessly to researchers.\n\n\"The device is smaller than a single M&M and only one-twentieth of the weight,\" Burton said.\n\nThe device can be tiny, and even flexible like a sheet of paper, because it does not need a battery. It harvests energy from external oscillating magnetic fields gathered by a miniature antenna on the device. This allows researchers to study brain activity without the use of restrictive equipment and gives neuroscientists a platform to gain insight into the underpinning mechanisms of the brain.\n\n\"When creating the device, we used materials and methods that are readily available and cheap enough to enable large-scale adaptation of the tool by the scientific community,\" said study senior author Philipp Gutruf, who leads the Gutruf Lab and is an assistant professor of biomedical engineering and member of the university's BIO5 Institute. \"We hope that the technology can make a difference in fighting neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and cast light on the biological mechanisms, such as pain, addiction and depression.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211140950.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T19:09:50", "title": "Combining viral genomics and public health data revealed new details about mumps outbreaks", "text": "In 2016 and 2017, a surge of mumps cases at Boston-area universities prompted researchers to study mumps virus transmission using genomic data, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and local university health services. As the outbreaks unfolded, the teams analyzed mumps virus genomes collected from patients, revealing new links between cases that first appeared unrelated and other details about how the disease was spreading that weren't apparent from the epidemiological investigation.\n\nThe teams shared their sequencing data and findings in real-time during the outbreaks, with both each other and the broader scientific community, and now report their conclusions in PLOS Biology.\n\nAnalyzing viral genomes from an outbreak can show how a virus is evolving and being transmitted -- data that can help public health officials slow and stop the spread of disease.\n\n\"High-resolution genomic data about a virus, gathered from patient samples, allows us to reconstruct parts of an outbreak that aren't evident at first,\" said co-senior author Pardis Sabeti, institute member at the Broad Institute, professor at Harvard University, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. \"The better we understand transmission chains in situations like this, the better we can inform efforts to control outbreaks and devise strategies to predict and stop them in the future.\"\n\nIn Massachusetts, the typical rate of mumps is less than 10 cases per year -- but more than 250 cases were reported in 2016 and more than 170 in 2017, despite high rates of vaccination. Many of the cases were from 18 colleges and universities in the state, including Harvard University, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Boston University (these three universities met certain criteria to ensure patient privacy protection in this study and agreed to be named in the paper). Other outbreaks flared elsewhere in Boston and across the country around the same time.\n\nThese patterns of cases raised questions about how much the virus was circulating in the Massachusetts and US populations. To learn more, the research teams paired traditional epidemiological data with analysis of mumps virus whole genome sequences from 201 infected individuals, focusing primarily on the Massachusetts university communities.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMumps insight\n\nThe viral genomic data revealed details about the Boston-area outbreaks that could not be reconstructed by relying solely on more traditional approaches. For example, the researchers found a clear link between cases at Harvard and an outbreak in East Boston, which were classified as distinct outbreaks during the initial public health investigation.\n\nPublic health officials first thought the cases in these two communities were unrelated based on several pieces of evidence: epidemiological data, the different demographic makeup of the two populations (older adults with no obvious university connection versus mostly college-aged students), and a long gap between the apparent end of the outbreak at Harvard and the cases in the local community.\n\nHowever, the genomic data indicated that the mumps viruses in the East Boston cases were genetically similar to those in the Harvard virus samples. This finding enabled the teams to identify contacts and transmission links between the university and the wider community.\n\n\"Even though the two outbreaks were occurring at different places and different times, we were able to show connections between these outbreaks that were operationally informative,\" explained senior co-author Bronwyn MacInnis, associate director of malaria and viral genomics in the Infectious Disease and Microbiome Program and co-lead of the Global Health Initiative at Broad. \"The public health teams could determine that they were essentially dealing with one problem, not two.\"\n\nUnderstanding such transmission routes can help guide the outbreak response -- for example, by determining whether efforts should be focused more on controlling transmission within a single community or between different ones.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Whole-genome sequencing of patient samples helps us reconstruct the progression of an outbreak,\" said co-first author Shirlee Wohl, formerly a Harvard graduate student in the Sabeti lab and now a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University. \"Traditional outbreak surveillance efforts can help identify possible sources of infection, but whole-genome sequencing can confirm these links and even suggest new, unexplored connections.\"\n\nThe team emphasized that this study was made possible by the close partnerships it had with the Massachusetts Department of Health and the health services teams at several universities. \"I am proud to be part of the Massachusetts higher education community,\" Sabeti added. \"They worked together and demonstrated the necessity of transparency in outbreak response. This is not a story of mumps at these universities, but of outstanding mumps reporting.\"\n\nMutating mumps?\n\nAnother question of particular interest to the local teams was whether a new mutation in the mumps virus -- for example, one that allows it to evade the immune system in a vaccinated individual -- might have sparked the outbreak. Of the infected individuals, 65 percent had received the recommended two doses of the MMR vaccine. However, given the available data, the researchers found no evidence that genetic variants arising specifically during this outbreak contributed to the disease spread. This finding suggests that, in the Boston area, the virus wasn't evolving into one that could dodge vaccine-induced immunity.\n\nIn addition to the findings related to the Boston-area outbreaks, the study's broader geographic analysis suggested that the mumps virus has been circulating continuously at a low rate around the US, only rarely flaring up into notable outbreaks as in 2016 and 2017.\n\n\"This whole endeavor demonstrated the value of genetic data to the epidemiological health response, and of data-sharing among collaborating teams,\" Sabeti said. \"One of our goals is to build this capacity in many areas around the world so that public health officials can rapidly mobilize and do this type of analysis whenever they need to.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211140948.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T19:09:48", "title": "Pilot program aims to improve reproducibility, utility, and ethics of biomedical research: Researchers conduct 'large scale behavior change intervention' with new tools and monetary incentives", "text": "Addressing the widespread concern over transparency and reproducibility in biomedical research, one of the largest institutions in German science has begun to provide a framework, interventions, and incentives for improving the quality and value of translational research.

These bugs, dubbed in the computer science field as performance regressions, are time-consuming to fix since locating software errors normally requires substantial human intervention.\n\nTo overcome this obstacle, researchers at Texas A&M University, in collaboration with computer scientists at Intel Labs, have now developed a complete automated way of identifying the source of errors caused by software updates. Their algorithm, based on a specialized form of machine learning called deep learning, is not only turnkey, but also quick, finding performance bugs in a matter of a few hours instead of days.\n\n\"Updating software can sometimes turn on you when errors creep in and cause slowdowns. This problem is even more exaggerated for companies that use large-scale software systems that are continuously evolving,\" said Dr. Abdullah Muzahid, assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. \"We have designed a convenient tool for diagnosing performance regressions that is compatible with a whole range of software and programming languages, expanding its usefulness tremendously.\"\n\nThe researchers described their findings in the 32nd edition of Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems from the proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in December.\n\nTo pinpoint the source of errors within a software, debuggers often check the status of performance counters within the central processing unit. These counters are lines of code that monitor how the program is being executed on the computer's hardware in the memory, for example. So, when the software runs, counters keep track of the number of times it accesses certain memory locations, the time it stays there and when it exits, among other things. Hence, when the software's behavior goes awry, counters are again used for diagnostics.\n\n\"Performance counters give an idea of the execution health of the program,\" said Muzahid. \"So, if some program is not running as it is supposed to, these counters will usually have the telltale sign of anomalous behavior.\"\n\nHowever, newer desktops and servers have hundreds of performance counters, making it virtually impossible to keep track of all of their statuses manually and then look for aberrant patterns that are indicative of a performance error. That is where Muzahid's machine learning comes in.\n\nBy using deep learning, the researchers were able to monitor data coming from a large number of the counters simultaneously by reducing the size of the data, which is similar to compressing a high-resolution image to a fraction of its original size by changing its format. In the lower dimensional data, their algorithm could then look for patterns that deviate from normal.\n\nWhen their algorithm was ready, the researchers tested if it could find and diagnose a performance bug in a commercially available data management software used by companies to keep track of their numbers and figures. First, they trained their algorithm to recognize normal counter data by running an older, glitch-free version of the data management software. Next, they ran their algorithm on an updated version of the software with the performance regression. They found that their algorithm located and diagnosed the bug within a few hours. Muzahid said this type of analysis could take a considerable amount of time if done manually.\n\nIn addition to diagnosing performance regressions in software, Muzahid noted that their deep learning algorithm has potential uses in other areas of research as well, such as developing the technology needed for autonomous driving.\n\n\"The basic idea is once again the same, that is being able to detect an anomalous pattern,\" said Muzahid. \"Self-driving cars must be able to detect whether a car or a human is in front of it and then act accordingly. So, it's again a form of anomaly detection and the good news is that is what our algorithm is already designed to do.\"\n\nOther contributors to the research include Dr. Mejbah Alam, Dr. Justin Gottschlich, Dr. Nesime Tatbul, Dr. Javier Turek and Dr. Timothy Mattson from Intel Labs.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211134432.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T18:44:32", "title": "More than just a carnival trick: Researchers can guess your age based on your microbes", "text": "Our microbiomes -- the complex communities of microbes that live in, on and around us -- are influenced by our diets, habits, environments and genes, and are known to change with age. In turn, the makeup of our microbiomes, particularly in the gut, is well-recognized for its influence on our health. For example, gut microbiome composition has been linked to inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune disease, obesity, even neurological disorders, such as autism.\n\nGiven a microbiome sample (skin, mouth or fecal swab), researchers have demonstrated they can now use machine learning to predict a person's chronological age, with a varying degree of accuracy. Skin samples provided the most accurate prediction, estimating correctly to within approximately 3.8 years, compared to 4.5 years with an oral sample and 11.5 years with a fecal sample. The types of microbes living in the oral cavity or within the gut of young people (age 18 to 30 years old) tended to be more diverse and abundant than in comparative microbiomes of older adults (age 60 years and older).\n\nThe predictive tool, described in a paper published February 11, 2020 by mSystems, was developed as a collaboration between researchers at University of California San Diego and IBM.\n\n\"This new ability to correlate microbes with age will help us advance future studies of the roles microbes play in the aging process and age-related diseases, and allow us to better test potential therapeutic interventions that target microbiomes,\" said co-senior author Zhenjiang Zech Xu, PhD, who was at the time of the study a postdoctoral researcher in the UC San Diego School of Medicine lab of co-senior author Rob Knight, PhD, professor and director of the UC San Diego Center for Microbiome Innovation.\n\nThe team's ultimate goal is to create similar machine learning models to correlate microbiome and clinical conditions, such as inflammation in autoimmune conditions. This approach could someday form the basis for a noninvasive microbiome-based test that potentially helps clinicians better diagnose or assess a person's risk for a disease.\n\nIn a 2014 study, Washington University researchers compared \"microbial age\" -- age as predicted by the fecal microbiome -- and actual chronological age in the context of malnourished infants during the first months of life. The researchers noted that the difference between chronological and microbial age was associated with the degree of the children's developmental maturity. In the new study, UC San Diego researchers took this idea a step further to see if this association could apply to adults, and how well it generalized to other body sites.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to Xu, one of the most important requirements for a good statistical model is a large sample size and a representative population. To do that, the researchers mined microbiome sequencing data available from the public databases of several citizen science projects, such as the American Gut Project, in which participants mail in fecal, saliva or skin swabs, receive their personalized microbiome readouts, and contribute their anonymized data to the scientific community.\n\nThe study relied on a total of 4,434 fecal samples from the US and China, 2,550 saliva samples from the US, Canada, UK and Tanzania, and 1,975 skin samples from the U.S. and U.K. The participants whose data were used in the study ranged in age from 18 to 90 years old, with body mass indices of 18.5 to 30, did not have inflammatory bowel disease or diabetes, and had not used antibiotics for at least one month prior to sampling. The study also excluded pregnant, hospitalized, disabled or critically ill individuals.\n\n\"This was the most comprehensive investigation of microbiome and age to date,\" said first author Shi Huang, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Knight's lab and the UC San Diego Center for Microbiome Innovation.\n\nThe team found gender-specific differences in gut microbiome results, but no difference between males and females when it came to oral and skin microbiome results. Despite the diversity of microbes living on different sites across the human body, it also made no difference whether the skin samples had been collected from foreheads or hands, meaning future skin microbiome studies can boost their statistical power by combining collection sites and genders.\n\nOne potential reason the microbes living on our skin change so consistently as we age, the researchers said, is due to the predictable changes in skin physiology that everyone experiences, such as decreased serum production and increased dryness.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"The accuracy of our results demonstrate the potential for applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to better understand human microbiomes,\" said co-author Ho-Cheol Kim, PhD, program director of the Artificial Intelligence for Healthy Living Program, a collaboration between IBM Research and UC San Diego under the IBM AI Horizons Network. \"Applying this technology to future microbiome studies could help unlock deeper insights into the correlation between how microbiomes influence our overall health and a wide range of diseases and disorders from neurological to cardiovascular and immune health.\"\n\nAccording to co-author Yoshiki V\u00e1zquez-Baeza, PhD, associate director of bioinformatic integration at the UC San Diego Center for Microbiome Innovation, age prediction is a particularly attractive method for training predictive models because participants don't need to meet special criteria in order to become a sample donor, and assessing age typically does not require a visit to a hospital.\n\n\"Other studies that focus on one particular condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, often struggle to get enough participants who meet the study criteria and who are willing to participate in order to be able to draw meaningful conclusions,\" V\u00e1zquez-Baeza said. \"But here, the wide applicability of age-prediction allowed us to explore the limits of microbial modeling at an unprecedented scale.\"\n\n\"Learning how to create accurate and robust microbiome-based models will open the door to a number of biotechnological applications, and help us better understand the relationship of certain bacteria with outcomes of interest,\" Knight said.\n\nDisclosure: Amir Zarrinpar is a cofounder and holds equity interest in Tortuga Biosciences.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211134430.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T18:44:30", "title": "Disease found in fossilized dinosaur tail afflicts humans to this day", "text": "The fossilized tail of a young dinosaur that lived on a prairie in southern Alberta, Canada, is home to the remains of a 60-million-year-old tumor.\n\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University, led by Dr. Hila May of the Department of Anatomy and Anthropology at TAU's Sackler Faculty of Medicine and Dan David Center for Human Evolution and Biohistory Research, have identified this benign tumor as part of the pathology of LCH (Langerhans cell histiocytosis), a rare and sometimes painful disease that still afflicts humans, particularly children under the age of 10.\n\nA study on the TAU discovery was published on February 10 in Scientific Reports.

The study team used satellite estimates and modeled precipitation data to project how changing rainfall patterns in the region might affect landslide frequency. The study team found that warming temperatures will cause more intense rainfall in some areas, and this could lead to increased landslide activity in the border region of China and Nepal.\n\nMore landslides in this region, especially in areas currently covered by glaciers and glacial lakes, could cause cascading disasters like landslide dams and floods that affect areas downstream, sometimes hundreds of miles away, according to the study. The study was a collaboration between scientists from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Washington; and Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.\n\nHigh Mountain Asia stretches across tens of thousands of rugged, glacier-covered miles, from the Himalayas in the east to the Hindu Kush and Tian Shan mountain ranges in the west. As Earth's climate warms, High Mountain Asia's water cycle is changing, including shifts in its annual monsoon patterns and rainfall.\n\nHeavy rain, like the kind that falls during the monsoon season in June through September, can trigger landslides on the steep terrain, creating disasters that range from destroying towns to cutting off drinking water and transportation networks. In summer 2019, monsoon flooding and landslides in Nepal, India and Bangladesh displaced more than 7 million people. In order to predict how climate change might affect landslides, researchers need to know what future rainfall events might look like. But until now, the research making the landslide predictions has relied on records of past landslides or general precipitation estimate models.\n\n\"Other studies have either addressed this relationship very locally, or by adjusting the precipitation signal in a general way,\" said Dalia Kirschbaum, a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"Our goal was to demonstrate how we could combine global model estimates of future precipitation with our landslide model to provide quantitative estimates of potential landslide changes in this region.\"\n\nThe study team used a NASA model that generates a \"nowcast\" estimating potential landslide activity triggered by rainfall in near real-time. The model, called Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA), assesses the hazard by evaluating information about roadways, the presence or absence of nearby tectonic faults, the types of bedrock, change in tree cover and the steepness of slopes. Then, it integrates current precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Measurement mission. If the amount of precipitation in the preceding seven days is abnormally high for that area, then the potential occurrence of landslides increases.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe study team first ran LHASA with NASA precipitation data from 2000-2019 and NOAA climate model data from 1982-2017. They compared the results from both data sets to NASA's Global Landslide Catalog, which documents landslides reported in the media and other sources. Both data sets compared favorably with the catalog, giving the team confidence that using the modeled precipitation data would yield accurate forecasts.\n\nFinally, the study team used NOAA's model data to take LHASA into the future, assessing precipitation and landslide trends in the future (2061-2100) versus the past (1961-2000). They found that extreme precipitation events are likely to become more common in the future as the climate warms, and in some areas, this may lead to a higher frequency of landslide activity.\n\nMost significantly, the border region of China and Nepal could see a 30-70% increase in landslide activity. The border region is not currently heavily populated, Kirschbaum said, but is partially covered by glaciers and glacial lakes. The combined impacts of more frequent intense rainfall and a warming environment could affect the delicate structure of these lakes, releasing flash floods and causing downstream flooding, infrastructure damage, and loss of water resources.\n\nThe full human impact of increasing landslide risk will depend on how climate change affects glaciers and how populations and communities change. When they evaluated their model projections in the context of five potential population scenarios, the team found that most residents in the area will be exposed to more landslides in the future regardless of the scenario, but only a small proportion will be exposed to landslide activity increases greater than 20%.\n\nThe study demonstrates new possibilities for research that could help decision-makers prepare for future disasters, both in High Mountain Asia and in other areas, said Kirschbaum.\n\n\"Our hope is to expand our research to other areas of the world with similar risks of landslides, including Alaska and Appalachia in the United States,\" said Sarah Kapnick, physical scientist at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and co-author on the study. \"We've developed a method, figured out how to work together on a specific region, and now we'd like to look at the U.S. to understand what the hazards are now and in the future.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211121508.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T17:15:08", "title": "New synthesis methods enhance 3D chemical space for drug discovery", "text": "After helping develop a new approach for organic synthesis -- carbon-hydrogen functionalization -- scientists at Emory University are now showing how this approach may apply to drug discovery. Nature Catalysis published their most recent work -- a streamlined process for making a three-dimensional scaffold of keen interest to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\"Our tools open up whole new chemical space for potential drug targets,\" says Huw Davies, Emory professor of organic chemistry and senior author of the paper.\n\nDavies is the founding director of the National Science Foundation's Center for Selective C-H Functionalization, a consortium based at Emory and encompassing 15 major research universities from across the country as well as industrial partners.\n\nTraditionally, organic chemistry has focused on the division between reactive molecular bonds and the inert bonds between carbon-carbon (C-C) and carbon-hydrogen (C-H). The inert bonds provide a strong, stable scaffold for performing chemical synthesis with the reactive groups. C-H functionalization flips this model on its head, making C-H bonds become the reactive sites.\n\nThe aim is to efficiently transform simple, abundant molecules into much more complex, value-added molecules. Functionalizing C-H bonds opens new chemical pathways for the synthesis of fine chemicals -- pathways that are more direct, less costly and generate less chemical waste.\n\nThe Davies lab has published a series of major papers on dirhodium catalysts that selectively functionalize C-H bonds in a streamlined manner.\n\nThe current paper demonstrates the power of a dirhodium catalyst to efficiently synthesize a bioisostere of a benzene ring. A benzene ring is a two-dimensional (2D) molecule and a common motif in drug candidates. The bioisostere has similar biologicial properties to a benzene ring. It is a different chemical entity, however, with a 3D structure, which opens up new chemical territory for drug discovery.\n\nPrevious attempts to exploit this bioisostere for biomedical research have been hampered by the delicate nature of the structure and the limited ways to make them. \"Traditional chemistry is too harsh and causes the system to fragment,\" Davies explains. \"Our method allows us to easily achieve a reaction on a C-H bond of this bioisostere in a way that does not destroy the scaffold. We can do chemistry that no one else can do and generate new, and more elaborate, derivatives containing this promising bioisostere.\"\n\nThe paper serves as proof of principle that bioisosteres can serve as fundamental building blocks to generate an expanded range of chemical entities. \"It's like getting a new Lego shape in your kit,\" Davies says. \"The more Lego shapes you have, the more new and different structures you can build.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211121504.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T17:15:04", "title": "Pedal to the metal: Speeding up treatments for ALS", "text": "A therapeutic intervention for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, could be on the horizon thanks to unexpected findings by University of Arizona researchers.\n\nALS is the progressive degeneration of motor neurons that causes people to lose the ability to move and eventually speak, eat and breathe.\n\nWithin the neuronal cells of patients with ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases, two proteins -- TDP-43 and FUS -- are often found in bundles of molecular junk called aggregates, which can accumulate to deadly levels.\n\n\"It's not clear yet if TDP-43 aggregates themselves are truly toxic or a sign that things have gotten really bad in a cell, and this is its last Hail Mary trying to keep things in order,\" said Ross Buchan, assistant professor of molecular and cellular biology and a member of the BIO5 Institute. \"These aggregates could possibly be toxic because they are trapping other useful molecules and not letting them do their job.\"\n\nBuchan and his team set out to investigate how healthy cells clear harmful aggregates from the cell.\n\nWhat they found was that the aggregates were being removed via endocytosis, which was surprising for two reasons. First, the textbook definition of endocytosis is a process in which proteins, nutrients and chemical signals from outside the cell are brought inside to be degraded and recycled by the lysosome. But in this case, endocytosis was working on aggregates that were already inside the cell. And second, there's already a mechanism, called autophagy, in place for recycling junk that originated from within a cell, yet endocytosis was doing what autophagy should have been doing instead.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Autophagy -- and also likely, although it's still uncertain, endocytosis -- often slows as we age, and there are genes that are mutated in that pathway that are associated with some neurodegenerative diseases. So people thought the reason aggregates form when we get old, or when you have these diseases, is because that pathway isn't working very well,\" Buchan said.\n\nAdditionally, the accumulation of aggregates slows the endocytosis pathway further, creating a negative feedback loop within the cell.\n\n\"If we genetically or chemically impede the pathway, then the TDP-43 protein accumulates and becomes super toxic. The cool thing, as far as a therapy for ALS is concerned, is that we can also do the reverse,\" Buchan said. \"We can make the endocytosis pathway work better by over-expressing parts of it, like putting the gas pedal down so it goes really fast. When we do that, then the TDP-43 aggregates are cleared really efficiently and it's no longer toxic.\"\n\nMany of the paper's experiments were performed in yeast cells, but the general findings are likely translatable to human cells based on initial findings. Buchan called yeast \"a powerful genetic tool,\" for understanding cellular processes, including those in human disease.\n\nWhile the results from Buchan's lab are unexpected -- \"If I were to pull a textbook off the self, it would say endocytosis is for things that are outside the cell, not inside, so it's still pretty heretical,\" he said -- there are other labs with data suggesting endocytosis can also clear already internalized proteins.\n\nThe next step is to determine how TPD-43 and FUS enter the endocytic pathway, and then to develop ways to make endocytosis work better in these cells.\n\n\"There are genetic ways to do that, but not chemically at the moment,\" Buchan said. \"We think if we have a drug that inhibits the negative regulators of endocytosis, the pathway will go faster as a result.

The disease is caused by a one-celled parasite called Plasmodium. It is passed on from person to person as female Anopheles mosquitoes pick up the parasite from infected people when they bite to get the blood needed to nurture their eggs. Inside the mosquito the parasites reproduce, multiply and develop.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs part of their latest research, the team wanted to better understand how the parasite's cell divides and multiplies especially within a mosquito.\n\nProteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. They do most of the work in cells and are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's tissues and organs. Each organism has DNA organised into a certain number of chromosomes and needs condensins in order to 'split' this DNA when they multiply. Condensins are large protein complexes that play a central role in chromosome assembly and segregation during mitosis and meiosis.\n\nIn the malaria parasite (Plasmodium), the role of condensins in multiplication and proliferation was unclear. The team looked at two of the crucial condensin subunits, called SMC2 and SMC4, which are required to maintain the structure of chromosomes in a cell of other organisms.\n\nProfessor Tewari said: \"We have tried to understand how these molecules work in the unusual pattern of multiplication by the parasite. We found that these molecules are there at all the stages of multiplication and they are present only at a certain part of the chromosome, which is called the centromere. We wanted to understand how does the parasite multiply? How do these molecules organise themselves and the DNA in those cells? It is fascinating how a single cell can carry out so many different modes of multiplication, and we need to understand how it does this.\"\n\nAfter analysing the parasite, the team found a very unusual type of cell division, showing that the malaria parasite has evolved ways to ensure its survival by way of its cell division.\n\nProfessor Tewari says: \"This particular parasite is very adaptable. Even if you kill it in the human blood stream, it can move into the mosquito stage. Over time, it has adapted to survive and has a lot of genetic plasticity, which is why it is difficult to control the disease.\n\n\"We need to understand what gives the parasite this plasticity and what it needs at every stage to survive, so it is crucial to understand how the parasite cell divides. The aim of our research is not to develop a drug immediately, but to answer the fundamental question of how the parasite divides and survives and the machinery it uses. The parasite has diverse modes of multiplying, so even if a drug or an effective vaccine is created, they may be able to adapt and we need to understand how. This is a next step towards that goal.\"\n\nProfessor Le Roch says: \"By understanding the fundamental aspect of parasite biology, we are decrypting how the parasite divides, and how the different mechanisms regulating cell division can affect the ability of the parasite to thrive and replicate exponentially inside its hosts. If we identify the molecular components that are essential for the replication of this parasite, we will be able to develop novel and long-lasting therapeutic strategies against this devastating disease.\"\n\nThis research is funded by MRC and BBSRC to Professor Tewari's group and by NIH grants to Prof Karine Le Roch's group.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211104913.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T15:49:13", "title": "How some butterflies developed the ability to change their eyespot size: A broad, comparative study reveals the evolution of a mechanism that allows a butterfly species to change its wing eyespot size", "text": "New insight on how a butterfly species developed the ability to adjust its wing eyespot size in response to temperature has been published today in eLife.\n\nThe study reveals that the African satyrid butterfly Bicyclus anynana (B. anynana), a member of the sub-family of the nymphalidae (or 'brush-footed') butterflies, changes its eyespot size using a complex physiological and molecular response that evolved gradually over millions of years. The findings also highlight that while temperature modulates hormone levels in various species of satyrid butterfly, B. anynana is just one of a few that take advantage of this response to regulate eyespot size.\n\nMany butterflies in the nymphalidae family have circular eyespot patterns on their wings that are typically used to deflect attacks from predators. However, in certain seasons, such as the dry season in Africa, the butterflies' best survival strategy is to avoid drawing attention to themselves, and they will shrink the size of their eyespots to make them look like a dead leaf.\n\nHow butterflies accomplish this feat has only been studied in one species of African satyrid, B. anynana. In this species, low temperatures that signal the arrival of the dry season lower the quantity of a hormone called 20E during the late larval stage. This alters the function of hormone-sensitive cells in the centre of the eyespots and subsequently shrinks their size.\n\n\"For our study, we investigated how this hormone-mediated system came to regulate the size of eyespots by examining the process in several other species of butterflies with and without eyespots,\" explains lead author Shivam Bhardwaj, who conducted this work as part of his doctoral research in the Department of Biological Sciences at the National University of Singapore (NUS), and who is now a postdoctoral fellow at Mississippi State University. \"We wanted to find out which other species change their eyespot size in response to temperature and whether they achieve this through the same mechanism as B. anynana. This comparative work would allow us to explore for the first time how a temperature-regulated system evolves at the genetic and physiological level.\"\n\nTo do this, Bhardwaj and his team reared 13 different species of satyrid at two different temperatures. They found that all species had lower levels of the 20E hormone in response to low temperatures, but most of them were unable to change the size of their eyespots accordingly. This included species that are known to have different eyespot sizes during wet and dry seasons. \"We also saw that a small group of species expressed the hormone receptor in their eyespot centres just like B. anynana, but this also was also not sufficient to shrink its size,\" says Bhardwaj.\n\nThe team then manipulated the 20E hormone in four of the 13 species, and found that B. anynana is the only one to have evolved a temperature and hormone-mediated system of eyespot size regulation. They suggest that this species gradually evolved the ability to change its eyespot size according to temperature as a result of seasonal variations in its natural African habitat.\n\nFurther studies are now needed to understand the different environmental cues that other butterflies use to alter the size of their eyespots during dry and wet seasons.\n\n\"For now, our work uncovers a complex, gradual adaptation to seasonal environments in B. anynana that required specific mutations to evolve,\" says senior author Ant\u00f3nia Monteiro, Associate Professor at NUS and at Yale-NUS College, Singapore. \"If other forms of adaptation are as difficult to evolve as the one identified in B. anynana, then our findings support a previous warning that many species may be vulnerable to extinction in the face of unpredictable and fluctuating temperatures caused by climate change.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211103833.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T15:38:33", "title": "Coincidences influence the onset and ending of ice ages", "text": "When we predict future climate, it is important to understand the climate of the past. We do. Mostly. Some details are still debatable.\n\nAn example of that are the periodicities of ice ages -- that is, how ice ages come and go. This is described in a theory developed by amongst others the astronomer Milankovitch in the 1920ies. The theory describes mathematically how incoming radiation from the sun varies over time because the orbit of the Earth around the sun is elliptical and our dear planet wobbles like a top.\n\nAll in all these small differences lead to continuous changes in the amount of light and heat that reaches the poles in a 40,000 year cycle and thus forces the climate in and out of ice ages and interglacials.\n\nIce ages hard to predict\n\nThe theory is good, but it doesn't explain everything. The periodicity of ice ages has not been as precise as the theory would indicate. Why is that? Is it because of noise in the system -- that is coincidences, that overshadow the general mechanism, or are the inconsistencies due to problems with the model? The question has long been debated.\n\nNow climate scientist from the TiPES project, Peter Ditlevsen from Physics of Ice, Climate and Earth at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen and colleagues Takahito Mitsui from the University of Tokyo and Michel Crucifix from UCLouvan in Belgium argue that coincidences play a large part.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn their paper, \"Crossover and peaks in the Pleistocene climate spectrum; understanding from simple ice age models,\" published today in the journal Climate Dynamics, they document that the climate system is more chaotic than the model indicates. A myriad of coincidences seem to displace the ice ages from the predictions of the theory.\n\nThe influence of coincidence\n\nIn other words -- the theory is good, but a large amount of noise can partly overrule the effect of the astronomical variations.\n\nIt is an analysis of the so called climate spectrum that has led to this conclusion. The climate spectrum is calculated from observed fluctuations in climate of the past. It shows how a range of different processes influence the climate -- rising and falling amounts of CO 2 , rising and falling amounts of energy from the sun, rising and falling amounts of geological activity and so on.\n\nSome of these changes come and go in short time spans others fluctuate over longer periods. That is, some have a high frequency, others a lower frequency. Together they explain the variation, the climate has endured over millions of years.\n\nIn the new analysis the climate spectrum is compared to expectations from different models of ice age variations. The analysis shows that the climate indeed is the result of a range of such underlying periodic processes but also of a large amount of background noise which is not periodic. That means coincidences play a large role in changes of the climate.\n\nTipping points might also be harder to predict\n\n\"With this result we can better understand, how ice ages come and go. But we also see, that the climate system can react abruptly and unpredictably to external influences like our current emmissions of carbon dioxide. That means it might be hard to calculate if -- or when we reach a tipping point in the climate system. And we should maybe apply a more conservative risk assesment then the one IPCC recommends,\" says Peter Ditlevsen.\n\nIf a tipping point is reached the Earth system will change irreversibly into another state.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211103827.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T15:38:27", "title": "New technique allows scientists to study parasitic infections one cell at a time: A novel technique that isolates individual gut cells from mice with intestinal parasites may yield new insights on the", "text": "A new technique may help scientists study the body's immune response to intestinal parasite infections one gut cell at a time, according to a study published today in eLife.\n\nIntestinal parasites are a serious threat to both humans and livestock in large parts of Africa, South America and Asia.

Once the parasites grow into adults inside the body, the immune system has a hard time getting rid of them and scientists have found it challenging to study immune cells in infected tissues.\n\n\"One big problem has been the difficulty to extract immune cells from an infected gut, as the infection causes very strong local reactions such as intense cellular slime production to try and flush the worms out,\" says senior author Johannes Mayer, PhD, Research Fellow at the Malaghan Institute of Medical Research in Wellington, New Zealand.\n\nMayer and colleagues tested many different ways to extract immune cells from the guts of mice infected with an intestinal parasite called Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri. Most of their attempts failed, but they eventually developed a technique that isolated millions of immune cells from the infected animals' guts. The technique involves three washes with EDTA, an agent to remove the mucus, lasting for 10 minutes. This is followed by 30 minutes in a solution of enzymes that help break down the tissue into individual cells, and then cell filtration.\n\n\"This allowed us to study the individual immune cells for the first time,\" explains lead author Laura Ferrer-Font, PhD, Staff Scientist at the Malaghan Institute of Medical Research. \"We used a new technology called spectral flow cytometry to look at many different types of immune cells all at the same time, and identified various changes that take place throughout the course of parasitic infection.\"\n\nThe team also verified that the immune changes they saw in the cells were representative of the immune changes that occurred in the tissue taken from the infected animals, ensuring that the cell-extraction process did not skew their findings.\n\n\"Now that we have found a way to extract immune cells from parasite-infected guts, we can start to answer important questions about the immune response,\" Mayer concludes. \"This technique will enable scientists to use powerful tools like single-cell RNA sequencing to study the immune response in different hosts.

When the team took into account the potential role of intelligence or education, the unadjusted relationship between height and dementia risk was only slightly reduced.\n\nThey found that the relationship between height and dementia also existed when they looked at brothers with different heights, suggesting that genetics and family characteristics alone do not explain why shorter men had a greater dementia risk. This was also true when they studied data concerning twins, although the results for this group were less certain.\n\n\"A key strength of our study is that it adjusted for the potential role of education and intelligence in young men's dementia risk, both of which may build up cognitive reserve and make this group less vulnerable to developing dementia,\" explains senior author Merete Osler, Professor at the Center for Clinical Research and Prevention, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, and at the University of Copenhagen.\n\n'Cognitive reserve' refers to the brain's ability to improvise and solve problems that come up in everyday life.

The production of germ cells involves both types of cell division called meiosis and mitosis. Following production, these cells fuse together during fertilisation to produce a cell that develops into a plant.\n\nMuch of our understanding of plant reproductive processes has come from studying dissected samples of plants under a microscope and by examining aberrations arising from mutations in plant genes involved in plant reproduction. However, these methods do not provide information about where and when different events happen during reproduction. Live imaging provides a way of capturing this important detail.\n\n\"Live imaging has been instrumental in research into root growth and development, but live-cell imaging of cell processes within the flower is technically much more challenging,\" explains co-first author Sona Valuchova, a postdoctoral researcher at the Central European Institute of Technology at Masaryk University, Czech Republic. \"There is a need to develop imaging methods in the context of whole organs or plants.\"\n\nValuchova and her colleagues used a technique called light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), where a sample is moved through a thin sheet of laser light, and a detector picks up three-dimensional image data. In this way, an entire flower that has been embedded in agar can be imaged quickly by moving it through the plane of light. The resulting 3D model shows intricate detail of the flower structure and can be used to track the fate of individual germ cells within it.\n\nHaving shown that LSFM could provide high-resolution images of flowers, the team's next goal was to establish that it could detect specific events in reproduction. To achieve this, they used flowers that had been engineered to have fluorescent labels on key molecules involved in meiosis and mitosis. They were able to capture the entire process of meiosis in male germ cells by detecting changes in the amount and location of a molecule called ASY1 every hour for four days.\n\nThe team went on to show that live imaging could be successfully used to study plant hormone levels during different stages of flower development and to watch the movement of chromosomes across the cell during cell division.\n\nOne of the most neglected areas of plant reproduction research is the production of female germ cells during female meiosis. Most studies on plant meiosis have focused on male germ cells because the female equivalent -- called the megaspore mother cell -- are incredibly rare and look very similar to other cells, making them hard to study. To overcome this, the team developed a version of live imaging specifically for female meiosis. \"This required careful dissection of the flower bud to reveal the ovules, which were then passed through the laser light every 10 minutes over 24 hours to create a 3D film,\" says co-first author Pavlina Mikulkova, also a senior scientist at the Central European Institute of Technology at Masaryk University. \"Using this technique, we were able to record the two phases of female meiosis and determine how long each one lasted.\"\n\n\"This work demonstrates the power of LSFM to provide novel information about plant reproduction that could not previously be studied by other types of microscopy,\" concludes senior researcher Karel Riha, Deputy Director for Research at the Central European Institute of Technology at Masaryk University. \"Our success in developing a live imaging protocol for female meiosis represents a major technical advancement in plant cell biology.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211103731.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T15:37:31", "title": "How the brain's immune system could be harnessed to improve memory", "text": "When it comes to memory, immune cells are known as the \"bad cops\" of the brain.

This is the result of genome research by an international team of biologists, coordinated at the University of Basel and published in the journal BMC Biology.\n\nWith its stocky, spotted body, big eyes and large mouth, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) may not be the most attractive of aquatic creatures, but it is one of the most successful invasive species of fish. Within a few years, it has spread rapidly around the world. Usually introduced via the ballast water from ships, the fish has now become the dominant species in terms of numbers in various fresh and salt waters. Its marked ability to adapt to new environments is apparently related to its immune system, as the researchers report based on their genome analysis.\n\nUp to 30 times more inflammation genes\n\nFor this analysis, the researchers read and assembled particularly long genome fragments from a round goby originating in Basel. Because of their length, these fragments produced an exceptionally complete genome, which was used to analyze gene families that were thought to relate to the fish's ability to deal with new environments. Here, the researchers described expansions in specific enzymes known as cytochrome P450.\n\nFurthermore, the zoologists found that all the genes deployed in inflammatory immune responses are present in the fish -- and, in some cases, up to 30 times more than in comparable species. This may help the round goby to deal with pathogens, thus favoring its successful colonization of waters around the world. But there is still one aspect that has the specialists puzzled: although round gobies are also found in highly polluted water -- in ports, for example -- they do not differ from other species in terms of detoxification.\n\nColder water than in their natural habitat\n\nFurthermore, the researchers came across the genetic basis that allows the round goby not only to produce but also to accumulate osmolytes -- substances that affect the osmotic state. These help the fish to deal not only with fluctuations in salinity but also with desiccation and cold. This could also explain why round gobies are also found in the Baltic Sea -- that is, in water temperatures far below those of their original habitat.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200211093944.htm", "published": "2020-02-11T14:39:44", "title": "Synthetic chemicals in soils are 'ticking time bomb'", "text": "A growing health crisis fueled by synthetic chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in groundwater has garnered much attention in the last few years.\n\nThe reported levels could be \"just the tip of the iceberg,\" as most of the chemicals are still migrating down slowly through the soil, according to Bo Guo, University of Arizona assistant professor of hydrology and atmospheric sciences.\n\nNearly 3,000 synthetic chemicals belong to the PFAS class. They have been used since the 1940s in food packaging, water-resistant fabrics, non-stick products, pizza boxes, paints, firefighting foams and more, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe chemicals don't break down in the environment, nor in the body, and a growing number of research papers have shown that PFAS contamination in water sources is widespread in the United States and that exposure is harmful to health.\n\n\"Because PFAS are in a lot of consumer and industrial products, they can get into wastewater. Treatment plants are not designed to treat these compounds, so these chemicals just stay in that water to get reused. It's sprayed on soccer fields or used to recharge aquifers, for example,\" said Mark Brusseau, professor of environmental science. \"PFAS can also get into the biosolids, which are land-applied as fertilizer, so there are all these sources, which means they could have entered the environment at many different time periods and repeatedly.\"\n\nTo understand how the chemicals migrate through the soil between the land surface and groundwater -- an area called the vadose zone -- University of Arizona researchers developed a novel mathematical model to simulate the different complex processes that affect the transport and retention of these chemicals.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTheir findings are published in the journal Water Resources Research.\n\nTheir model showed that the majority of PFAS chemicals accumulate in places where air contacts the surface of water trapped in the soil, which significantly slows the chemicals' downward march to groundwater.

Participants read one of three possible endings.\n\nIn one scenario, the victim bought coffee for the thief (under-retribution/forgiveness); in another, the victim stole a $50 bottle of whiskey from the thief (equitable retribution); and in the third version the victim both stole his money back and downloaded porn onto the thief's work computer (over-retribution).\n\nImmediately after reading each scenario, the participants were asked if they liked or disliked the narrative. More people liked the equitable retribution stories than those that involved under- or over-retribution, Grizzard said.\n\nThe researchers also timed how long it took the readers to click the like or dislike button on the computer after reading each of the narratives.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThey found that readers took less time to respond to stories with equitable retribution than it did for them to respond to stories with under- or over-retribution.\n\n\"People have a gut-level response as to how they think people should be punished for wrongdoing and when a narrative delivers what they expect, they often respond more quickly,\" Grizzard said.\n\nWhen the punishment did not fit the crime, the participants took a bit longer to respond to the story with a like or dislike. But why they took longer appeared to be different for stories with under-retribution versus stories with over-retribution, Grizzard said. The reason why may be explained by the next part of the study.\n\nAfter the participants read all 15 narratives, they rated each story for enjoyment (\"This story would be a good time, fun, entertaining\") and appreciation (\"This story would be meaningful, moving, thought-provoking\").\n\nParticipants thought stories in which the bad guys were over-punished would be the most enjoyable and those in which the bad guys were forgiven would be the least enjoyable to watch. Equitable punishment was in the middle.\n\nBut they also said they would appreciate the stories about forgiveness more than the other two types of narratives.\n\nSo the participants may have paused slightly before responding to the forgiveness stories to reflect, because they saw them as more meaningful, Grizzard said.\n\nBut while they also paused for the over-punishment narratives, they did not find them more meaningful, only more enjoyable, he said. That suggests the pause may have been simply to savor the extra punishment the villain received.\n\n\"It appears to be the darker side of just enjoying the vengeance,\" he said.\n\nOverall, the results suggest that a fair and just retribution is the \"intuitive moral standard\" that comes to us easily and naturally, according to Grizzard.\n\n\"But seeing a lack of punishment requires a level of deliberation that doesn't come to us naturally.

Species that build their webs in well-lit environments are more likely to evolve the yellow mosaic colour pattern, found to be so effective at luring prey in these experiments.\n\nHowever, this colour pattern rarely evolves in species that have little opportunity to lure prey, perhaps because they are concealed in a retreat or build their webs in dark caves.\n\nDr Po Peng, lead author of the study, said, \"Our discoveries indicate that the effectiveness of colour-luring to attract prey might be a major driver for the yellow mosaic pattern being present in distantly related orb-weaver spiders.\"\n\nThe significance of the yellow colour may be due to yellow pollen and flower heads being common in flowers that signal to diurnal (active during the day) pollinators. Previous research has also found that some nocturnal (active at night) lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) can discriminate colours under dim light conditions and innately prefer yellow.\n\nOrb weaving spiders comprise around 12,500 species, making up 28% of the 45,000 described spider species. The groups defining trait is that they construct webs which they sit in the middle of to forage for prey.\n\nNephila pilipes were used in these experiments as they are active both diurnally and nocturnally, making them excellent species to study visual prey lures. Flies and bees make up the majority of their diurnal prey; moths and butterflies make up the majority of their nocturnal prey.\n\nThe researchers conducted the field experiments at Huayan Mountain in Taiwan between 2008 -- 2009.

When the first domino is toppled, it transfers its energy to its neighbor, initiating a wave that sequentially switches all building blocks from high to low energy states.\n\nThe researchers focused on a simple system of bistable joints linked by rigid bars.

We're not quite there with existing or preliminary technology -- yet.\n\nAs implied by the \"tube\" of their nanostructure, BNNTs are hollow in the middle. They're highly insulating and as strong and bendy as an Olympic gymnast. That made them a good candidate to pair with another material with great electrical promise: tellurium. Strung into atom-thick chains, which are very thin nanowires, and threaded through the hollow center of BNNTs, tellurium atomic chains become a tiny wire with immense current-carrying capacity.\n\n\"Without this insulating jacket, we wouldn't be able to isolate the signals from the atomic chains. Now we have the chance to review their quantum behavior,\" Yap said. \"The is the first time anyone has created a so-called encapsulated atomic chain where you can actually measure them. Our next challenge is to make the boron nitride nanotubes even smaller.\"\n\nA bare nanowire is kind of a loose cannon. Controlling its electric behavior -- or even just understanding it -- is difficult at best when it's in rampant contact with flyaway electrons. Nanowires of tellurium, which is a metalloid similar to selenium and sulfur, is expected to reveal different physical and electronic properties than bulk tellurium. Researchers just needed a way to isolate it, which BNNTs now provide.\n\n\"This tellurium material is really unique. It builds a functional transistor with the potential to be the smallest in the world,\" said Peide Ye, the lead researcher from Purdue University, explaining that the team was surprised to find through transmission electron microscopy at the University of Texas at Dallas that the atoms in these one-dimensional chains wiggle. \"Silicon atoms look straight, but these tellurium atoms are like a snake. This is a very original kind of structure.\"\n\nThe tellurium-BNNT nanowires created field-effect transistors only 2 nanometers wide; current silicon transistors on the market are between 10 to 20 nanometers wide. The new nanowires current-carrying capacity reached 1.5x10^8 cm2, which also beats out most semiconducting nanowires. Once encapsulated, the team assessed the number of tellurium atomic chains held within the nanotube and looked at single and triple bundles arranged in a hexagonal pattern.\n\nAdditionally, the tellurium-filled nanowires are sensitive to light and pressure, another promising aspect for future electronics. The team also encased the tellurium nanowires in carbon nanotubes, but their properties are not measurable due to the conducting or semiconducting nature of carbon.\n\nWhile tellurium nanowires have been captured within BNNTs, like a firefly in a jar, much of the mystery remains. Before people begin sporting tellurium T-shirts and BNNT-laced boots, the nature of these atomic chains needs characterizing before its full potential for wearable tech and electronic cloth can be realized.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200210165723.htm", "published": "2020-02-10T21:57:23", "title": "How some mammals pause their pregnancies: Biochemical reasons for lag times between conception and pregnancy in mice became clearer in a recent study", "text": "How do some mammals postpone the development of their embryos to await better conditions for having offspring? A recent study at the UW Medicine Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine explored this reproductive enigma, which can occur in more than 130 species of mammals as well as in some marsupials.\n\nThe study was study led by Abdiasis Hussein, a graduate student in the lab of Hannele Ruohola-Baker, UW professor of biochemistry and associate director of UW Medicine's Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine. The findings were reported in Developmental Cell, a Cell Press scientific journal.\n\nThe results not only advance the understanding of delayed embryo implantation, but also suggest how some otherwise rapidly dividing cells, such as those in tumors, become quiescent.\n\nIn the suspended state of pregnancy called embryonic diapause, an early-stage embryo refrains from implanting in the mother's uterus, where it could be nourished to grow into a baby. Instead, like a seed, the embryo remains dormant until certain molecular regulators prod it to germinate.\n\nDiapause, or delayed implantation, is a biological strategy for waiting out conditions unfavorable to sustaining newborns, such as lack of food, insufficient maternal fat stores, or older siblings who haven't been weaned.\n\nBears, armadillos, seals, and some otters, badgers and other weasel-like animals undergo seasonal diapause, as a regular part of their reproductive cycles.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMany types of bears, for example, breed in the late spring or early summer. The female then voraciously hunts for food. Only when the female bear has sufficient body fat and weight will one or more of her embryos implant months later, after she retreats to her den. Any cubs would be born in late winter.\n\nTo learn what puts a biochemical hold-and-release on embryonic development, Hussein, Ruohola-Baker and their team induced diapause in a female mouse model by reducing estrogen levels. They then compared diapause embryos to pre-implantation and post-implantation embryos. They also induced diapause in mouse embryonic stem cells by starving the cells, and compared those to actively growing mouse embryonic stem cells.\n\nIn the wild, some animal embryos will delay implantation until their mother has enough energy and nutrients in her body to support them. Starvation or other stresses somehow provoke an embryonic stop-time. This response is an effort to protect their survival.\n\nThe researchers did extensive studies of how metabolic and signaling pathways control both the dormant and active states of mouse embryos and of mouse embryonic stems cells in lab dishes.\n\nMetabolism concerns the life-sustaining chemical activities cells carry out to convert substances into energy, build materials, and remove waste. By analyzing these reactions' end products, called metabolites, the scientists could begin to pull together a picture of what happens to cause diapause, and how cells are released from its clutches.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe scientists also looked at gene expression in comparing cell states. They sought to determine what might be influencing how the DNA code was being interpreted, what critical proteins were being produced and in what amounts, in the suspended and active states.\n\nAccording to embryonic stem cell researcher Ruohola-Baker, epigenetic differences in interpreting the same DNA code, rather than any alterations in the DNA itself, may be key to understanding how embryos enter and exit diapause.\n\nFurther investigation pointed to a set of proteins vital in embryonic cell survival. The activity of the genes related to these proteins, as well as levels of certain amino acids, were ramped up in the diapausal embryos. For example, by using CRISPR gene-editing technology, Hussein and Julie Mathieu, UW assistant professor of comparative medicine, squelched the flow of glutamine, an amino acid that controls an important metabolic (energy-use) pathway.\n\nThe researchers collected additional data that indicated that this and other metabolic factors influenced a catalytic enzyme, mTOR, that regulates many cell processes, including cell proliferation, growth, and protein synthesis. mTOR is also involved in \"sensing\" cell nutrient and energy stores.\n\nmTOR is already known to be a central regulator of metabolism and physiology in mammalian aging and cancer. It also manages aspects of embryonic growth and development. In this study, situations that inhibited mTOR led to the distinct metabolic profile that characterizes diapause. Researchers also found that this inhibition was reversible.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms behind diapause could advance knowledge in medicine, as well as in wildlife biology. Carol Ware, a UW professor of comparative medicine, said that diapause is an essential means of survival for some species, and occurs under environmental stress in others.\n\nResearch on the mechanism of diapause in animals is an important step in seeing if this cellular response can be harnessed for clinical therapies, such as better in vitro fertilization procedures to help people have children.\n\nHussein believes this line of research might also have significance for future cancer studies. Figuring out why and when cancer cells enter quiescence might help explain their hunkering down to withstand chemotherapy, and reviving themselves later. Perhaps a therapy eventually could be devised, he said, that could wake up the cells to coincide with the timing of anti-cancer drugs.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200210165721.htm", "published": "2020-02-10T21:57:21", "title": "Adapting to climate change: We're doing it wrong: Researchers, policymakers should focus on transformative strategies", "text": "When it comes to adapting to the effects of climate change, scientists and policymakers are thinking too small, according to a new research review.\n\nThe authors argue that society should focus less on how individuals respond to such climate issues as flooding and wildfires and instead figure out what it takes to inspire collective action that will protect humans from climate catastrophes on a much grander scale.\n\nOhio State University researchers analyzed studies that have been published to date on behavioral adaptation to climate change. They found that most studies have emphasized the psychology behind individual coping strategies in the face of isolated hazards, and came from the point of view of a single household managing their own risk.\n\nWhat is needed, they propose, is systems-level thinking about what is truly adaptive for society, and research on the dynamics that lead people to change entire systems through transformational actions and on barriers that keep people from embracing transformative efforts.\n\n\"What we know about adaptation has come from a longer history of studying the sorts of things that are getting worse because of climate change,\" said Robyn Wilson, lead author of the paper and a professor of risk analysis and decision science in Ohio State's School of Environment and Natural Resources.\n\n\"If we want to really adapt to climate change, we're talking about transformational change that will truly allow society to be resilient in the face of these increasing hazards.

When the incremental nature of adaptation research became evident, the review became a platform to sound an alarm: We can't take baby steps anymore when it comes to being ready for all that climate change will bring.\n\n\"Thinking holistically is part of what transformation research is all about -- saying we have to work together to really think differently,\" Wilson said. \"We can't all be individually running around doing our own thing. We need to think beyond the selfish individual who says, 'What do I need to do to be better off?'\"\n\nTake, for example, preservation of a seaside community. Current activities may include building municipal floodwalls and, as individuals, moving valuables to higher ground and letting insurance resolve problems as they arise. Instead, the authors suggest, a look at a much bigger picture could clarify whether the coastal community should exist at all.\n\nWilson said there was a time when researchers avoided studying adaptation for fear it would redirect attention and efforts away from mitigation -- addressing the causes of climate change rather than its effects.\n\n\"Eventually, there was a recognition that we have to do both. We don't really have a choice,\" she said. \"We have to adapt while also mitigating so we can try to avoid the really catastrophic outcomes that will come down the road for children today. The worst-case things aren't happening tomorrow, but they're happening on a time frame that will impact people we care about.\"\n\nIn biological terms, survival requires adaptation. Is there a chance those impacts could threaten the human species?\n\nadvertisement\n\nThough plenty of civilizations have failed, Wilson doesn't expect humans to go extinct as a result of even the worst-case climate scenario: global warming of 8 or 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the 21st century.\n\n\"Somebody's going to survive,\" she said. \"It's more a question of social equity and social justice.\n\n\"Fast-forward a couple hundred years and someone will be here. But if we don't think from a more transformative standpoint of how society should be structured and where we should live and how we should live, there will be a lot of losers -- those with the least resources and low socioeconomic status and people in developing countries. ...

The approach could improve production processes for electrolysis and electrochemical energy conversion and storage.\n\n\"There has been extensive effort to find new high-performance catalysts that can also better withstand electrochemical reactions,\" said Jiaxing Huang, professor of materials science and engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering, who led the research. \"We developed a drastically different approach to make electrocatalysis less prone to decay -- not by finding another new material, but by doing the reaction differently.\"\n\nThe study, titled \"Fluidized Electrocatalysis,\" was published on February 10 in the journal CCS Chemistry.\n\nIn a typical electrocatalysis setting, once catalytic materials are glued onto the electrode, they are soaked in electrolyte and undergo a reaction spurred by a voltage. Since the voltage is continuously applied through the electrode, the materials experience continuous electrochemical stress. Over time, their catalytic performance can decay due to accumulated structural damage in the electrode as a whole, or on individual particles.\n\nThe team's approach avoids the continuous stress by fluidizing the particles in the electrolyte. Now the particles work in rotation, experiencing electrochemical stress only momentarily when colliding with the electrode. Collectively, the output from the individual collision events merge into a continuous and stable electrochemical current.\n\n\"Fluidized electrocatalysis breaks the spatial and temporal continuum of electrochemical reactions, making the catalysts more efficient.\" Huang said. \"Fluidization also reduces the mass transport limit of the reactants to the catalyst, since the particles are swimming in the electrolyte.\"\n\nHuang tested his ideas using a well-known, commercially available catalyst called Pt/C, which is made of carbon black powders decorated by platinum nanoparticles to catalyze oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, and methanol oxidation reactions. These three electrochemical reactions, when catalyzed by Pt/C, normally suffer from severe performance decay, but all showed higher efficiency and stability when the particles were fluidized.\n\n\"The new strategy makes an unstable catalyst deliver stable performance for all three of the model reactions. It was an exciting proof-of-concept,\" said Yi-Ge Zhou, the first author of the paper and a former visiting postdoc in Huang's group. \"When we calculated single particle efficiency for some of these reactions, it was at least three orders of magnitude higher than the fixed particles. Instead of stressing them out, we gave the particles a chance to relax, and they became a lot more efficient as a result.\"\n\nWhile more work is needed to identify the types of electrochemical reactions that could best maximize the benefit of fluidized electrocatalysis, Huang believes his method could be applied to a variety of different types of materials and produce more efficient, longer lasting electrocatalytic reactions. This could lead to improved electrochemical synthesis processes, which play an important role in converting energy to chemicals for large-scale energy storage.\n\n\"I hope other researchers consider our method to re-evaluate their catalysts.

The cores provide a record of snowfall, atmospheric circulation and other environmental changes over time; the Byrd Center has one of the largest collections of ice cores in the world.\n\nDasuopu -- at 7,200 meters or 23,600 feet above sea level -- is the highest-altitude site in the world where scientists have obtained a climate record from an ice core. Dasuopu is located on Shishapangma, one of the world's 14 tallest mountains, which are all located in the Himalayas.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFor this study, the research team analyzed one core taken from Dasuopu in 1997 for 23 trace metals.\n\nThe ice cores operate as a sort of timeline, and show new ice forming in layers on the glacier over time. It is possible for researchers to tell almost the precise year a layer of the glacier formed because of environmental clues like snowfall or other known natural or human-made disasters. The ice the researchers evaluated formed between 1499 and 1992, the team determined. Their goal was to see whether human activity had affected the ice in any way, and, if so, when the effects had begun.\n\nTheir analysis showed it had: The team found higher-than-natural levels of a number of toxic metals, including cadmium, chromium, nickel and zinc, in the ice starting at around 1780 -- the very start of the Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom. Those metals are all byproducts of burning coal, a key part of industry at the end of the 18th century and throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe researchers found that those metals were likely transported by winter winds, which travel around the globe from west to east.\n\nThey also believe it is possible that some of the metals, most notably zinc, came from large-scale forest fires, including those used in the 1800s and 1900s to clear trees to make way for farms.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"What happens is at that time, in addition to the Industrial Revolution, the human population exploded and expanded,\" Gabrielli said. \"And so there was a greater need for agricultural fields -- and, typically, the way they got new fields was to burn forests.\"\n\nBurning trees adds metals, primarily zinc, to the atmosphere. Gabrielli said it is difficult to tell whether the glacial contamination comes from human-made or natural forest fires. And there are few high-altitude records of large-scale fires from around the world, making that contamination more difficult to track.\n\nThe contamination in the ice core records was most intense from about 1810 to 1880, the scientists' analysis found. Gabrielli said that is likely because winters were wetter than normal in Dasuopu during that time period, meaning more ice and snow formed. That ice and snow, he said, would have been contaminated by fly ash from the burning of coal or trees that made its way into the westerly winds -- and greater quantities of contaminated ice and snow means more contamination on the glacier.\n\nNoteworthy to Gabrielli was that the contamination appeared long before humans scaled the mountains around Dasuopu. The first mountain climbers reached the summit of Mount Everest, at 29,029 feet the world's highest peak above sea level, in 1953. Shishapangma, at 26,335 feet the 14th-highest peak in the world, was first climbed in 1964. The Dasuopo glacier drilling site is about 2,700 feet below the summit.\n\nGabrielli said it is also important to note the difference between \"contamination\" and \"pollution.\"\n\n\"The levels of metals we found were higher than what would exist naturally, but were not high enough to be acutely toxic or poisonous,\" he said. \"However, in the future, bioaccumulation may concentrate metals from meltwater at dangerous toxic levels in the tissues of organisms that live in ecosystems below the glacier.\"\n\nThis study shows that human activity altered the atmosphere in the Himalayas starting at the end of the 18th century. But a previous study Byrd Polar Center researchers published in 2015 showed that in other parts of the world, namely Peru, human mining for silver contaminated the air in South America as many as 240 years before the Industrial Revolution.\n\n\"What is emerging from our studies, both in Peru and in the Himalayas, is that the impact of humans started at different times in different parts of the planet,\" Gabrielli said.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200210153334.htm", "published": "2020-02-10T20:33:34", "title": "Chemistry technique is 'warp drive' for creating better synthetic molecules for medicine", "text": "In a study with implications for the future of drug discovery, Scripps Research scientists showed they were able to turn simple chemicals into unique 3-D structures resembling those found in nature -- structures with desirable properties for medicines.\n\nIn the process, they found a potential drug lead for inflammatory disease, which is now being investigated further. The research appears in Nature Chemistry.\n\n\"We were able to start with flat molecules and use a single chemical operation to create much more complex shapes, such as those you would expect from metabolites of medicinal plants or marine organisms,\" says Ryan Shenvi, PhD, Scripps Research chemistry professor and senior author of the study. \"In essence, we found a way to bridge the gap between the synthetic space and natural products, opening up a whole new realm to explore for potential drugs.\"\n\nNature's advantage\n\nIn the field of drug discovery, compounds made by nature are thought to have some advantages over synthetic molecules, which are created from simple chemical feedstocks. Much of it has to do with their shape: so-called \"natural products\" tend to have complex, spherical 3-D structures that bind more precisely with molecules in the body, providing favorable drug attributes such as fewer side effects.\n\nSynthetic molecules used in the early stages of drug discovery, on the other hand, are typically flat, simple structures that are more likely to interact broadly with other molecules in the body. However, because they're so easy to create, they're more widely available for experimentation. When scientists are looking for a new drug to treat a particular disease, they will often turn to libraries of millions of synthetic molecules in the hopes of finding a needle in the haystack.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"But a bigger haystack doesn't necessarily mean you'll find more needles,\" says Shenvi. \"It usually just means more hay.\"\n\nEscaping flatland\n\nFor this reason, Shenvi and his Scripps Research lab have been working for several years on creating new tools to \"escape flatland\" -- or build better drug candidates than the flat molecules that dominate traditional drug-screening libraries. The approach described in Nature Chemistry relies on a surprising chemical reaction stumbled upon by the Shenvi group in 2015.\n\n\"No one would have predicted that this reaction would work,\" says first author Benjamin Huffman, a predoctoral fellow in Shenvi's lab. \"We even tried artificial intelligence-based prediction technology that is currently being rolled out.\"\n\nBut because the experiment would be relatively quick, Huffman and Shenvi decided to try it anyway, testing it on simple chemical compounds known as butenolides, which are byproducts from the corn oil refining industry. To their surprise, the compounds bonded almost instantaneously -- their electron clouds joining together to form a new molecule with unexpected complexity. The remarkable rate of the reaction piqued their interest and suggested an unusual driving force that might prove to be general.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Our next step was to find out if this reaction would work with other molecules that have different properties,\" Shenvi says. \"So, we built a small collection of these unusual constructs.\"\n\nWarp speed transformations\n\nInitial experiments showed that the reaction has the same effect on many different types of flat synthetic molecules, transforming them into desirable 3-D shapes that look like they could have been produced by a living cell.\n\nA major portion of the study then sought to understand, retrospectively, how the reaction occurred in the first place, which required collaboration with Kendall Houk, PhD, at the University of California, Los Angeles, and postdoctoral fellow Shuming Chen, PhD, in Houk's lab. One challenge was the speed of the reaction; it happened inexplicably fast, rendering the commonly used measurement tools useless.\n\nShenvi likens the reaction to \"warp drive\" in the TV series Star Trek, which enabled interstellar travelers to reach new frontiers of space faster than ever before. However, this chemical warp drive allows the researchers to explore distant regions chemical space.\n\nAlready, the approach has turned up one potential new drug lead: a compound that inhibits the expression of a protein known to play a role in autoimmune diseases.\n\nAfter handing off the compound collection to Calibr's high-throughput screening facility, one of the molecules was immediately identified by Scripps Research staff scientist Emily Chin, PhD, and Professor Luke Lairson, PhD, of the Chemistry Department, for its ability act on a cell signaling pathway known as cGAS/STING. This pathway plays a key role in inflammation and is implicated in autoimmune disorders. The Lairson and Shenvi labs are continuing to investigate the possible lead.\n\n\"We are now taking a step back to carefully analyze the chemistry and see if we can expand this kind of result to other areas,\" Shenvi says. \"Our goal is to blur the line between synthetic and natural product space and enable the discovery of new disease-relevant mechanisms.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200210153332.htm", "published": "2020-02-10T20:33:32", "title": "Impact of oil contaminated water on tubeworms and brittlestars", "text": "A new study published by Dauphin Island Sea Lab researchers adds a new layer to understanding how an oil spill could impact marine life.\n\nA diverse community of worms and other marine organisms on the seafloor plays a significant role in nutrient cycling, organic matter burial, and remineralization.

The mesocosm is a flowthrough facility with tanks large enough to include the elements of field realism, but small enough to control some factors.\n\nThe research exposed tube worms and brittlestars to seawater that had been mixed and contaminated with oil but had the oil solids removed.

Garvie's collection contains specimens from the Cretaceous through the Eocene -- a time period starting about 66 million years ago and lasting about 32 million years. It provided a great opportunity to study how periods of climate change during that time impacted mollusk communities.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"This research is a prime example of a scientific study that would not have been possible without a citizen scientist and the excellent collections at the Non-Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory,\" said Martindale.\n\nDuring the time the research focuses on, the Earth was in a warmer state than it is today, with no large ice sheets covering the poles. Even in this \"hot house\" state, the period contained multiple temperature spikes that warmed the planet even more. One of these spikes -- the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) -- occurred about 55 million years ago and is frequently compared to the human-driven climate change happening today. During the PETM, atmospheric carbon dioxide rose rapidly, which in turn caused average global temperatures to rise by 9 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWhile the PETM led to a decline in coral reef communities and the mass extinction of seafloor dwelling plankton called foraminifera, the Gulf Coast mollusks survived.\n\n\"It does highlight that even in events that we think are devastating, there's still a bit of hope from these resilient communities,\" Martindale said.\n\nThe scientists found that some mollusk species did go extinct in the 32 million-year period they studied, however they didn't find any link between those extinctions and temperature spikes, which suggests they were not related to climate change.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile Gulf Coast mollusks made it through the PETM and other temperature spikes unscathed, Foster said that this period of warming may only go so far as an analog for climate change happening today.\n\nThe Earth today is in an overall cooler state than it was during the PETM, and temperatures are rising much faster, meaning that mollusks -- along with other life -- may need to make a larger adjustment to their lifestyles in less time.\n\n\"The mollusks that live in the Gulf today are adapted to a colder climate, and the lack of impact in our study differs to projected changes because in the Early Cenozoic, global warming was happening in an already hot world,\" Foster said.\n\nAlong with climate change, Foster said that Gulf Coast mollusks are facing additional pressure from modern threats of overfishing, pollution, invasive species and loss of habitat, all which have the potential to drive regional extinctions.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Helmholtz Association.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200210153323.htm", "published": "2020-02-10T20:33:23", "title": "To slow an epidemic, focus on handwashing: Improving the rate of handwashing at just 10 major airports could significantly slow the spread of a viral disease, researchers estimate", "text": "A new study estimates that improving the rates of handwashing by travelers passing through just 10 of the world's leading airports could significantly reduce the spread of many infectious diseases. And the greater the improvement in people's handwashing habits at airports, the more dramatic the effect on slowing the disease, the researchers found.\n\nThe findings, which deal with infectious diseases in general including the flu, were published in late December, just before the recent coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, but the study's authors say that its results would apply to any such disease and are relevant to the current outbreak.\n\nThe study, which is based on epidemiological modeling and data-based simulations, appears in the journal Risk Analysis. The authors are Professor Christos Nicolaides PhD '14 of the University of Cyprus, who is also a fellow at the MIT Sloan School of Management; Professor Ruben Juanes of MIT's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering; and three others.\n\nPeople can be surprisingly casual about washing their hands, even in crowded locations like airports where people from many different locations are touching surfaces such as chair armrests, check-in kiosks, security checkpoint trays, and restroom doorknobs and faucets. Based on data from previous research by groups including the American Society for Microbiology, the team estimates that on average, only about 20 percent of people in airports have clean hands -- meaning that they have been washed with soap and water, for at least 15 seconds, within the last hour or so. The other 80 percent are potentially contaminating everything they touch with whatever germs they may be carrying, Nicolaides says.\n\n\"Seventy percent of the people who go to the toilet wash their hands afterwards,\" Nicolaides says, about findings from a previous ASM study. \"The other 30 percent don't. And of those that do, only 50 percent do it right.\" Others just rinse briefly in some water, rather than using soap and water and spending the recommended 15 to 20 seconds washing, he says. That figure, combined with estimates of exposure to the many potentially contaminated surfaces that people come into contact with in an airport, leads to the team's estimate that about 20 percent of travelers in an airport have clean hands.\n\nImproving handwashing at all of the world's airports to triple that rate, so that 60 percent of travelers to have clean hands at any given time, would have the greatest impact, potentially slowing global disease spread by almost 70 percent, the researchers found. Deploying such measures at so many airports and reaching such a high level of compliance may be impractical, but the new study suggests that a significant reduction in disease spread could still be achieved by just picking the 10 most significant airports based on the initial location of a viral outbreak. Focusing handwashing messaging in those 10 airports could potentially slow the disease spread by as much as 37 percent, the researchers estimate.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThey arrived at these estimates using detailed epidemiological simulations that involved data on worldwide flights including duration, distance, and interconnections; estimates of wait times at airports; and studies on typical rates of interactions of people with various elements of their surroundings and with other people.\n\nEven small improvements in hygiene could make a noticeable dent. Increasing the prevalence of clean hands in all airports worldwide by just 10 percent, which the researchers think could potentially be accomplished through education, posters, public announcements, and perhaps improved access to handwashing facilities, could slow the global rate of the spread of a disease by about 24 percent, they found. Numerous studies (such as this one) have shown that such measures can increase rates of proper handwashing, Nicolaides says.\n\n\"Eliciting an increase in hand-hygiene is a challenge,\" he says, \"but new approaches in education, awareness, and social-media nudges have proven to be effective in hand-washing engagement.\"\n\nThe researchers used data from previous studies on the effectiveness of handwashing in controlling transmission of disease, so Juanes says these data would have to be calibrated in the field to obtain refined estimates of the slow-down in spreading of a specific outbreak.\n\nThe findings are consistent with recommendations made by both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. Both have indicated that hand hygiene is the most efficient and cost-effective way to control disease propagation. While both organizations say that other measures can also play a useful role in limiting disease spread, such as use of surgical face masks, airport closures, and travel restrictions, hand hygiene is still the first line of defense -- and an easy one for individuals to implement.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile the potential of better hand hygiene in controlling transmission of diseases between individuals has been extensively studied and proven, this study is one of the first to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of such measures as a way to mitigate the risk of a global epidemic or pandemic, the authors say.\n\nThe researchers identified 120 airports that are the most influential in spreading disease, and found that these are not necessarily the ones with the most overall traffic. For example, they cite the airports in Tokyo and Honolulu as having an outsized influence because of their locations. While they respectively rank 46th and 117th in terms of overall traffic, they can contribute significantly to the spread of disease because they have direct connections to some of the world's biggest airport hubs, they have long-range direct international flights, and they sit squarely between the global East and West.\n\nFor any given disease outbreak, identifying the 10 airports from this list that are the closest to the location of the outbreak, and focusing handwashing education at those 10 turned out to be the most effective way of limiting the disease spread, they found.\n\nNicolaides says that one important step that could be taken to improve handwashing rates and overall hygiene at airports would be to have handwashing sinks available at many more locations, especially outside of the restrooms where surfaces tend to be highly contaminated. In addition, more frequent cleaning of surfaces that are contacted by many people could be helpful.\n\nThe research team also included Demetris Avraam at the University of Cyprus and at Newcastle University in the U.K., Luis Cueto-Felgueroso the Polytechnic University of Madrid, and Marta Gonzalez at the University of California at Berkeley and MIT.

Bats' fierce immune systems drive viruses to higher virulence, making them deadlier in humans", "text": "It's no coincidence that some of the worst viral disease outbreaks in recent years -- SARS, MERS, Ebola, Marburg and likely the newly arrived 2019-nCoV virus -- originated in bats.\n\nA new University of California, Berkeley, study finds that bats' fierce immune response to viruses could drive viruses to replicate faster, so that when they jump to mammals with average immune systems, such as humans, the viruses wreak deadly havoc.\n\nSome bats -- including those known to be the original source of human infections -- have been shown to host immune systems that are perpetually primed to mount defenses against viruses. Viral infection in these bats leads to a swift response that walls the virus out of cells. While this may protect the bats from getting infected with high viral loads, it encourages these viruses to reproduce more quickly within a host before a defense can be mounted.\n\nThis makes bats a unique reservoir of rapidly reproducing and highly transmissible viruses. While the bats can tolerate viruses like these, when these bat viruses then move into animals that lack a fast-response immune system, the viruses quickly overwhelm their new hosts, leading to high fatality rates.\n\n\"Some bats are able to mount this robust antiviral response, but also balance it with an anti-inflammation response,\" said Cara Brook, a postdoctoral Miller Fellow at UC Berkeley and the first author of the study. \"Our immune system would generate widespread inflammation if attempting this same antiviral strategy. But bats appear uniquely suited to avoiding the threat of immunopathology.\"\n\nThe researchers note that disrupting bat habitat appears to stress the animals and makes them shed even more virus in their saliva, urine and feces that can infect other animals.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Heightened environmental threats to bats may add to the threat of zoonosis,\" said Brook, who works with a bat monitoring program funded by DARPA (the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) that is currently underway in Madagascar, Bangladesh, Ghana and Australia. The project, Bat One Health, explores the link between loss of bat habitat and the spillover of bat viruses into other animals and humans.\n\n\"The bottom line is that bats are potentially special when it comes to hosting viruses,\" said Mike Boots, a disease ecologist and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology. \"It is not random that a lot of these viruses are coming from bats. Bats are not even that closely related to us, so we would not expect them to host many human viruses. But this work demonstrates how bat immune systems could drive the virulence that overcomes this.\"\n\nThe new study by Brook, Boots and their colleagues was published this month in the journal eLife.\n\nBoots and UC Berkeley colleague Wayne Getz are among 23 Chinese and American co-authors of a paper published last week in the journal EcoHealth that argues for better collaboration between U.S. and Chinese scientists who are focused on disease ecology and emerging infections.\n\nVigorous flight leads to longer lifespan -- and perhaps viral tolerance\n\nAs the only flying mammal, bats elevate their metabolic rates in flight to a level that doubles that achieved by similarly sized rodents when running.\n\nadvertisement\n\nGenerally, vigorous physical activity and high metabolic rates lead to higher tissue damage due to an accumulation of reactive molecules, primarily free radicals. But to enable flight, bats seem to have developed physiological mechanisms to efficiently mop up these destructive molecules.\n\nThis has the side benefit of efficiently mopping up damaging molecules produced by inflammation of any cause, which may explain bats' uniquely long lifespans. Smaller animals with faster heart rates and metabolism typically have shorter lifespans than larger animals with slower heartbeats and slower metabolism, presumably because high metabolism leads to more destructive free radicals. But bats are unique in having far longer lifespans than other mammals of the same size: Some bats can live 40 years, whereas a rodent of the same size may live two years.\n\nThis rapid tamping down of inflammation may also have another perk: tamping down inflammation related to antiviral immune response. One key trick of many bats' immune systems is the hair-trigger release of a signaling molecule called interferon-alpha, which tells other cells to \"man the battle stations\" before a virus invades.\n\nBrook was curious how bats' rapid immune response affects the evolution of the viruses they host, so she conducted experiments on cultured cells from two bats and, as a control, one monkey. One bat, the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), a natural host of Marburg virus, requires a direct viral attack before transcribing its interferon-alpha gene to flood the body with interferon. This technique is slightly slower than that of the Australian black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), a reservoir of Hendra virus, which is primed to fight virus infections with interferon-alpha RNA that is transcribed and ready to turn into protein. The African green monkey (Vero) cell line does not produce interferon at all.\n\nWhen challenged by viruses mimicking Ebola and Marburg, the different responses of these cell lines were striking. While the green monkey cell line was rapidly overwhelmed and killed by the viruses, a subset of the rousette bat cells successfully walled themselves off from viral infection, thanks to interferon early warning.\n\nIn the Australian black flying fox cells, the immune response was even more successful, with the viral infection slowed substantially over that in the rousette cell line. In addition, these bat interferon responses seemed to allow the infections to last longer.\n\n\"Think of viruses on a cell monolayer like a fire burning through a forest. Some of the communities -- cells -- have emergency blankets, and the fire washes through without harming them, but at the end of the day you still have smoldering coals in the system -- there are still some viral cells,\" Brook said. The surviving communities of cells can reproduce, providing new targets for the the virus and setting up a smoldering infection that persists across the bat's lifespan.\n\nBrook and Boots created a simple model of the bats' immune systems to recreate their experiments in a computer.\n\n\"This suggests that having a really robust interferon system would help these viruses persist within the host,\" Brook said. \"When you have a higher immune response, you get these cells that are protected from infection, so the virus can actually ramp up its replication rate without causing damage to its host. But when it spills over into something like a human, we don't have those same sorts of antiviral mechanism, and we could experience a lot of pathology.\"\n\nThe researchers noted that many of the bat viruses jump to humans through an animal intermediary. SARS got to humans through the Asian palm civet; MERS via camels; Ebola via gorillas and chimpanzees; Nipah via pigs; Hendra via horses and Marburg through African green monkeys. Nonetheless, these viruses still remain extremely virulent and deadly upon making the final jump into humans.\n\nBrook and Boots are designing a more formal model of disease evolution within bats in order to better understand virus spillover into other animals and humans.\n\n\"It is really important to understand the trajectory of an infection in order to be able to predict emergence and spread and transmission,\" Brook said.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200210144852.htm", "published": "2020-02-10T19:48:52", "title": "Twist in the story of volcanism and mass extinctions", "text": "An emerging scientific consensus is that gases -- in particular carbon gases -- released by volcanic eruptions millions of years ago contributed to some of Earth's greatest mass extinctions.

But it does conclude that there must have been something extra at work.\n\n\"Ellen's work is new in that scientists have previously guessed what the geochemical fingerprint of CO 2 from these giant eruptions might be, but our findings are some of the first direct measurements of this fingerprint,\" said Black.\n\n\"Our finding challenges the idea that carbon from this kind of eruption might be special, and therefore capable of easily matching changes in the carbon cycle during mass extinctions. It also helps us understand how volcanic eruptions move carbon -- a key ingredient for life and climate -- around inside the Earth and between the solid Earth and the atmosphere,\" said Gales.\n\nIn addition, the CCNY research also offers insights into Earth's current climate. \"Right now, people are releasing large quantities of CO 2 into the atmosphere. In a way, we are heading into almost uncharted territory,\" noted Black. \"This scale of CO 2 release has only happened a few times in Earth's history, for example during rare, enormous volcanic eruptions like the ones we studied.\"\n\nConsequently, Black pointed out, even though volcanic eruptions on the scale of these enormous volcanic provinces are not expected any time soon, understanding the environmental changes triggered by prodigious volcanic CO 2 release in the deep past is important for understanding how Earth's climate could change in the coming centuries.\n\nThe researchers used samples collected from ancient volcanic eruptions including the 252-million-year-old Siberian Traps.

In certain circumstances, it may do just the opposite.\n\nNew research published in Psychological Science, the flagship journal of the Association for Psychological Science, suggests that someone who helps a total stranger is generally viewed as morally better and more trustworthy than someone who helps a family member. But this is true only if the helper did not have to choose between those options.\n\nThrough a series of five online experiments, a team of psychology researchers from Boston College and Harvard University recruited more than 1,300 volunteers and asked them to evaluate several \"Good Samaritan\" scenarios. The goal was to determine if familial obligations factor into people's everyday judgments of moral character, and if so, in what way.\n\nIn each of these scenarios, the researchers manipulated one specific element: whether the person being helped was a stranger or, alternatively, was distantly related to the person lending a hand. The good deeds presented in the tests were basic courtesies, like helping someone move into a new apartment. They did not require extreme physical or financial sacrifice.\n\nIn one series of tests, participants read scenarios in which only one person -- either a stranger or kin -- could be helped. People who helped a stranger were judged as more morally good and more trustworthy than people who helped an equally deserving family member.\n\n\"In these cases, we found that perceptions of a helper's moral character clearly changed based on whether their help was directed at a family member,\" said Ryan McManus, a second-year PhD student at Boston College and lead author on the paper.

Helping one meant forgoing help to the other.\n\nThe addition of this either/or choice reversed the outcome. Participants judged that people who chose to help a stranger over a family member were less morally good and less trustworthy than people who opted to help a family member.\n\n\"What struck us was how clearly participants' judgments changed when they viewed these acts of kindness through the lens of choice between kin and strangers,\" said McManus.\n\nThe researchers think these seemingly contradictory character judgments are actually connected by a single principle: familial obligation.\n\nThis same concept carried over into a third series of tests in which people simply chose to offer no help at all, (e.g., preferring to play videogames rather than help a neighbor move into a new apartment). In these cases, people who ignored the needs of a stranger were judged less critically than people who withheld help from a family member.\n\n\"The take-home message from this work is that, from a third-party perspective, the way that we think about others' moral character depends on who their helpful, or unhelpful, behavior is directed at,\" concluded McManus.\n\nThe team plans to continue their investigations by examining the role of obligations in judgment when comparing closely related family members to more distant relations.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200210144848.htm", "published": "2020-02-10T19:48:48", "title": "Superior 'bio-ink' for 3D printing pioneered: Researchers are developing materials to help grow human tissues", "text": "Rutgers biomedical engineers have developed a \"bio-ink\" for 3D printed materials that could serve as scaffolds for growing human tissues to repair or replace damaged ones in the body.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Biointerphases.\n\nBioengineered tissues show promise in regenerative, precision and personalized medicine; product development; and basic research, especially with the advent of 3D printing of biomaterials that could serve as scaffolds, or temporary structures to grow tissues.\n\nHyaluronic acid, a natural molecule found in many tissues throughout the body, has many properties ideal for creating customized scaffolds, but lacks the durability required.

For instance, a very common application is for the production of fats from vegetable oils. In industry, production of paraffin is an example.\n\n\"Hydrogenation is an old and well established method that relies on the use of a finely divided metal such as palladium, often supported on charcoal,\" said Lakshman, a Fellow of Britain's Royal Society of Chemistry and a former vice chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. \"It also needs a source of hydrogen gas, which to date is available from compressed hydrogen gas cylinders.

The task required them to unpredictably hold back from pressing a left or right key.

Yet when Catherine Nabukalu was taking courses on energy as part of her master's degree in environmental studies at Penn, she noticed charcoal was often left out of the conversation about energy sources and their contribution to global carbon emissions.\n\n\"We would systematically go through coal, then nuclear, then hydropower, then geothermal, solar, etc.,\" says Nabukalu, now a project coordinator at the District of Columbia Sustainable Energy Utility. \"You become aware that something is missing. Just because you don't have electricity, doesn't mean you don't have energy.\"\n\nReto Gier\u00e9, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science, encouraged her to research charcoal as an energy source for her final paper in his course, Energy, Waste, and the Environment. He then helped her get funding to travel to her native Uganda to continue to pursue the topic as an independent project that they conceptualized together. Nabukalu and Gier\u00e9 shared the findings in a paper published in the journal Resources.\n\n\"I'm African, and I've used charcoal personally,\" says Nabukalu. \"It's not fun to use, cooking is often not a healthy or enjoyable experience, but it's a big part of the energy mix. It's not the only source, but it's one of them.\"\n\nAs a step toward better understanding the full life cycle of charcoal, from creation to consumption, Nabukalu spent time at a number of sites in Uganda where charcoal is created, traded, sold, and consumed. She observed and interviewed participants at each of these stages and reviewed the literature about charcoal production and use worldwide. Gier\u00e9 and Nabukalu shared some of the key results from this research with Penn Today that shed light on an overlooked source of energy.\n\nProducing charcoal supports a nomadic lifestyle\n\nIn the locations Nabukalu visited, people produced charcoal by felling trees, stacking their trunks, and covering them with branches and leaves. A final layer of damp soil serves to keep as much oxygen as possible out when the pile is set alight. In this way, the wood undergoes pyrolysis instead of combustion, leaving behind carbon-dense charcoal.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThese kiln installations are created and used only once. \"In some cases, this necessitates that the people who use them are nomads,\" Gier\u00e9 notes.\n\nIndeed, some workers interviewed had moved to northern Uganda from the central region specifically for the opportunity to produce charcoal. \"Some were entrepreneurs who moved on their own because they thought the trees were disappearing in the more southern areas,\" says Nabukalu. \"But others were contracted by entrepreneurs that had informal companies to do this work.\"\n\nCharcoal production takes a serious environmental toll and is difficult to regulate\n\nDespite efforts by the Ugandan government to regulate charcoal production, it takes place by and large on private lands and thus is nearly impossible to suppress. \"Partially, it's because the government has limited power on private land, but also there is strong demand for the product,\" Nabukalu says. Neighboring Tanzania attempted a ban that lasted only a couple of weeks, she found, as prices for charcoal soared on a quickly established black market.\n\nFor landowners, allowing charcoal production on their property can be a win-win. They may wish to clear land for agriculture and can invite charcoal producers onto their land, receiving a portion of the proceeds of the product's eventual sale. For the producers, it gives them a source of income without needing to own land.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile this type of small-scale charcoal production doesn't involve clearcutting, it still leads to forest degradation as the felled trees are unlikely to be replaced. Each year, Africa produces 24.5 million metric tons of charcoal, nearly 60% of the world's supply. In addition, much of the supply chain is informal, without any oversight. With traders selling charcoal far from where it is sourced, it is hard to track or quantify how much is actually being produced.\n\n\"I think a lot of reports grossly underestimate how much charcoal is being produced and used,\" Nabukalu says.\n\nAccess to alternative energy sources does not eliminate the use of charcoal\n\nNabukalu knew from personal experience that access to electricity did not obviate charcoal use. \"It's a matter of home economics,\" she says. \"When cooking, either you're going to use charcoal which you've already paid for, or you're going to turn on the gas or the electricity, but you don't know how high the bill will be.\"\n\nIn her research she found that Egypt, a country with a diversified mix of modern sources of energy, was still a top producer and importer of charcoal.\n\nThat's true not only in Africa but around the world.\n\n\"Take a look at Europe: Having wide and reliable access to electricity hasn't stopped usage there,\" she says, noting that Germany is the world's top charcoal importer. \"You could ask,\" Gier\u00e9 says, \"do people in Germany really need to be using it? There it's for a Sunday barbecue as a leisure fuel, whereas in Uganda it's used for daily cooking.\"\n\nCooking with charcoal can be dangerous\n\nNabukalu and Gier\u00e9 note the health impacts of cooking with charcoal, especially when done without proper ventilation.\n\n\"Burning biomass of any kind, whether it be firewood or charcoal, in a confined space exposes those nearby to fumes containing gases and particulates,\" says Gier\u00e9. \"Similarly, producing the charcoal generates vapors during the pyrolysis process, including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane, which all deteriorate air quality in the area surrounding the kilns.\"\n\nIn follow-up work, Hope Elliott, a student in Penn's Master of Science in Applied Geology program, also working with Gier\u00e9, is analyzing samples of the charcoal Nabukalu collected. In her research, Elliot is determining the chemical makeup of the charcoal and, by extension, the potential health effects of burning it.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200210133215.htm", "published": "2020-02-10T18:32:15", "title": "DNA-like material could bring even smaller transistors", "text": "Computer chips use billions of tiny switches, called transistors, to process information. The more transistors on a chip, the faster the computer.\n\nA material shaped like a one-dimensional DNA helix might further push the limits on a transistor's size. The material comes from a rare earth element called tellurium.\n\nResearchers found that the material, encapsulated in a nanotube made of boron nitride, helps build a field-effect transistor with a diameter of two nanometers. Transistors on the market are made of bulkier silicon and range between 10 and 20 nanometers in scale.\n\nThe research is published in the journal Nature Electronics. Engineers at Purdue University performed the work in collaboration with Michigan Technological University, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of Texas at Dallas.\n\nOver the past few years, transistors have been built as small as a few nanometers in lab settings. The goal is to build transistors the size of atoms.\n\nPeide Ye's lab at Purdue is one of many research groups seeking to exploit materials much thinner than silicon to achieve both smaller and higher-performing transistors.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"This tellurium material is really unique. It builds a functional transistor with the potential to be the smallest in the world,\" said Ye, Purdue's Richard J. and Mary Jo Schwartz Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering.\n\nIn 2018, the same research team at Purdue discovered tellurene, a two-dimensional material derived from tellurium. They found that transistors made with this material could carry significantly more electrical current, making them more efficient.\n\nThe discovery made them curious about what else tellurium could do for transistors. The element's ability to take the form of an ultrathin material in one dimension could help with downsizing transistors even further.\n\nOne way to shrink field-effect transistors, the kind found in most electronic devices, is to build the gates that surround thinner nanowires. These nanowires are protected within nanotubes.\n\nJing-Kai Qin and Pai-Ying Liao, Purdue electrical and computer engineering doctoral students, led work in figuring out how to make tellurium as small as a single atomic chain and then build transistors with these atomic chains or ultrathin nanowires.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThey started off growing one-dimensional chains of tellurium atoms. Wenzhuo Wu's lab at Purdue synthesized bare tellurium nanowires for comparison. A team led by Li Yang at Washington University simulated how tellurium might behave.\n\nThe researchers were surprised to find that the atoms in these one-dimensional chains wiggle. These wiggles were made visible through TEM imaging performed by Moon Kim at the University of Texas at Dallas and Hai-Yan Wang at Purdue.\n\n\"Silicon atoms look straight, but these tellurium atoms are like a snake. This is a very original kind of structure,\" Ye said.\n\nThe wiggles were the atoms strongly bonding to each other in pairs to form DNA-like helical chains, then stacking through weak forces called van der Waals interactions to form a tellurium crystal.\n\nThese van der Waals interactions would set apart tellurium as a more effective material for single atomic chains or one-dimensional nanowires compared with others because it's easier to fit into a nanotube, Ye said.\n\nSince the opening of a nanotube can't be any smaller than the size of an atom, tellurium helices of atoms could achieve smaller nanowires and, therefore, smaller transistors.\n\nThe researchers built a transistor with a tellurium nanowire encapsulated in a boron nitride nanotube, provided by physics professor Yoke Khin Yap's lab at the Michigan Technological University. A high-quality boron nitride nanotube effectively insulates tellurium, making it possible to build a transistor.\n\nXianfan Xu's lab at Purdue characterized the material's properties with Raman spectroscopy to benchmark its performance.\n\n\"This research reveals more about a promising material that could achieve faster computing with very low power consumption using these tiny transistors,\" said Joe Qiu, program manager for the U.S. Army Research Office, which funded this work. \"That technology would have important applications for the Army.\"\n\nThe work was also partly funded by the National Science Foundation, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

And that's a mathematical relationship.\"\n\nThe \"problem\" is that there's not a clear understanding of why the increase in geographic space is always accompanied by an increase in the numbers of species in that space.\n\n\"This observed relationship is pretty universal,\" Sobero\u0301n said. \"You can do it for islands or continental masses, in the tropics or in temperate regions -- wherever you do a plot of area versus number of species you get an increasing line. But why? Most explanations are based on the idea that the more individuals you sample, the more likely it is that they belong to a different species.\"\n\nBut Sobero\u0301n's new approach to species-area relationship is different. Rather than performing a headcount of animals (or plants) within a given geographic area, the KU researcher proposes calculating the number of \"Grinnellian niches,\" or conditions that support the existence of species in that area.\n\nHe said the method, expressed by mathematical formulae, could offer a more accurate roll call of species.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"What I did was to apply a theory we have been developing here at KU for the last 10 years, which is called 'Grinnellian-niche theory,'\" Sobero\u0301n said. \"Instead of concentrating on counting individuals, I explained this pattern in terms of the requirements of species for different climatic combinations. Different species have different climatic requirements, and if you can model that you can place the different requirements -- which are called 'niches' -- in environmental niche space. And when you increase the area you're looking at you are also increasing niche space. That's the bottom line.\"\n\nAccording to Sobero\u0301n, examples of niches could include water availability or the right temperature range.\n\n\"Some species tolerate very hot weather -- some species require less hot weather,\" he said. \"Some species can tolerate very dry environments; other species require water in different amounts. So, this combination of, say, from what lowest temperature to what highest temperature. From what driest environment to what wettest environment, from what acidity in the soil, and so on -- you derive these combinations of requirements, they're called niches.\"\n\nThe new approach refines the understanding of the species-area relationship because it accounts for factors beyond simply the size of an area. For instance, Sobero\u0301n said the Grinnellian-niche approach could account for variations in environment, such as temperature, that occur more powerfully north-to-south than east-to-west.\n\n\"Latitudinal effects are just one of the many things that conventional theories ignore,\" Sobero\u0301n said. \"But they play a very prominent role in the theory I've published, because it matters a lot whether you are moving, say, from Alaska to Central America, or vice versa. You encounter different species, different sets of tolerances and different niches. But in traditional theories, that doesn't matter because you just care about how much area -- the distinction is not made whether that's tropical area or temperate area or polar area. But for me that's a very major thing.\"\n\nTo hone his theoretical approach, Sobero\u0301n performed the Grinnellian analysis for North American mammals, then compared results with massive databases of known populations of species for the same region, subdivided into grids.\n\n\"There's an organization called the International Union for Conservation of Nature that has been convening meetings of experts from all over the world to draw the various distributions of terrestrial vertebrates -- mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians,\" the KU researcher said. \"We have databases which are publicly available with distributions, already established by these experts. This is the work of decades. In fact, anyone can download them. They are public. I chose to look at the mammals because, well, I am slightly familiar with mammals and I have friends that are very familiar with mammals and I could ask questions of them. So, I downloaded IUCN database, which I used to test -- and I also downloaded a GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) database, which is a huge database of observations of species. Those I used to do the calculations.\"\n\nSobero\u0301n said his new approach to biogeography could aid species conservation and species management across a spectrum of commercial and ecological efforts.\n\n\"It's a matter of universal concern, what species live in a particular place,\" he said. \"Those species may be species of conservation interest -- maybe you don't want tigers to go extinct, or gorillas. But there are also species of economic interest for people. For instance, there are plagues and diseases of crops, and you don't want to have those in your fields. There are species that transmit diseases for people, for instance, mosquitoes. So, the general problem of 'why did you find this species in a particular place?' is important for people. We care about certain species, and we don't want to have other species near us. And this combination of the ones that we'd like to keep, and the ones that we don't want to be close to us, is an instance of this general problem that I am dealing with in the paper.\"", "author": []}]}, "economist_business": {"rss": "https://www.economist.com/sections/business-finance/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.economist.com/topics/business", "articles": []}, "economist_science_and_tech": {"rss": "https://www.economist.com/sections/science-technology/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.economist.com/topics/science", "articles": []}, "fivethirtyeight_science": {"rss": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/feed/", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/", "articles": [{"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-were-already-primed-to-distrust-elections-then-came-iowa/", "published": "2020-02-11T16:06:26", "title": "Americans Were Already Primed To Distrust Elections. Then Came Iowa.", "text": "When the Iowa caucuses went to hell in a handbasket last week, they probably took some of Americans\u2019 last morsels of trust in the political system down too. But when I asked political scientists and psychologists about the impact of the bungled caucuses on overall political cynicism, they, by and large, weren\u2019t particularly concerned. The vast majority of voters probably won\u2019t care all that much, they said; instead, these experts are more worried about the indirect effects. Long after the shoddy apps have been forgotten, mistrust and bitterness could still be trickling down from political elites to everyone else.\n\nWe\u2019re already primed to think something\u2019s wrong with our voting system. Even before the caucuses, more than 40 percent of Americans felt the country wasn\u2019t prepared to keep the November elections secure, and 45 percent thought it was likely that not all votes were going to be counted. Partisans of a losing candidate are less likely to believe their vote was counted correctly, while winners get a boost in electoral confidence that can last for months.\n\nBut the Iowa debacle is important because it caused political elites to be as openly distrustful as some voters already are. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez tweeted an exasperated-sounding call for a recanvass of the results. Congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard railed against the lack of transparency and integrity in the caucuses. Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has also questioned the integrity of the process. And President Trump\u2019s two eldest sons both claimed that the caucuses had been rigged. (There is no evidence to suggest the caucus results were altered \u2014 just that the reporting process was run incompetently.)\n\nThese are all people at the top of the political influence pyramid, who have fans who share their political ideology and who have the media attention necessary to make their opinions widely known. The public doesn\u2019t just thoughtlessly follow what these political elites say, of course, but study after study has shown that what they say does matter.\n\nFor example, one 2018 paper used Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric about Mexican immigrants to conduct a natural experiment in how elites shape public opinion. The study compared the results of a fortuitously timed Gallup poll that asked about immigrants and immigration. Some of the poll was conducted before Trump\u2019s June 16, 2015, speech where he called immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and criminals, and some of the poll was conducted afterwards. The study found that public opinion against immigration hardened after the speech \u2014 the share of Americans who wanted to see less immigration jumped from 25 percent the day of the speech to 39 percent 10 days later.\n\n\u201cHow does democracy work? It works when losers believe there\u2019s been a fair election,\u201d said Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve taken for granted in this country for a long time.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s becoming more acceptable for political elites to challenge the outcomes of elections and make claims of fraud or outright electoral theft. Trump, after all, spent most of his 2016 campaign alleging that the election he eventually won would be stolen from him.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem for the future of democracy, said Eitan Hersch, a professor of political science at Tufts University and past FiveThirtyEight contributor, and unlike a lot of other political problems this country faces, it\u2019s one that both parties are engaging in. \u201cBoth parties have an incentive to rile their base with discussion of elections being stolen,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s probably bad for the system if people increasingly believe elections aren\u2019t fair.\u201d That seems to be what is happening.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, researchers are starting to suspect that the way outrage and accusations of stolen elections trickle down might do more than indirectly reduce trust \u2014 it could also lead the most level-headed voters to disengage from politics.\n\nThis is a fairly new idea, rooted in attempts to better understand a particular demographic of American voters \u2014 people who call themselves independents but really aren\u2019t. Although the Pew Research Center has found that 38 percent of Americans say they\u2019re independents (up from 33 percent in 1994), the vast majority of them are actually \u201cleaners\u201d \u2014 people who cop to having at least some level of party affiliation. Only 7 percent of independents are actually independent. The rest behave pretty similarly to partisans: Their beliefs and votes mostly track with those of their sorta favored party.\n\nYanna Krupnikov, a professor of political science at Stony Brook University, has been studying this demographic, trying to figure out what its deal is. She\u2019s come to the conclusion that these folks are not so much noncommittal as annoyed and disaffected. For example, while leaners mostly act like partisans, they do report lower rates of voting than partisans. They\u2019re also more likely to have negative opinions about both parties and dislike the candidates they have to choose from at all levels of government. Leaners may vote the same as partisans (when they do vote), but they aren\u2019t happy about it.\n\nAnd Krupnikov thinks that unhappiness stems from being sick and tired of hearing the complaints of partisans \u2014 particularly the minority of partisans who are heavily emotionally invested in the minutiae of politics. These partisans matter, said Krupnikov and others, because they\u2019re the ones listening to political elites and helping relay elites\u2019 ideas to the masses. But often times, the masses don\u2019t want to hear about it.\n\nWhen leaners hear about what happened in Iowa from news-obsessed partisans, \u201cit might persuade you that politics is about being angry and that politics isn\u2019t for you,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople become more likely to call themselves independents when they are reminded that partisans are constantly bickering with each other.\u201d\n\nKrupnikov\u2019s fear is that the outrage coming from elites and rank-and-file partisans could lead to more disaffected Americans who vote less and are less engaged in the political system. That concerns Hasen, too. There are studies that suggest the people most emotionally invested in politics \u2014 the ones who are seeking out the most information about it \u2014 are the ones most likely to be misled by inaccurate information. America needs the influence of the people who are less excitable, he told me.\n\nThe risk of Iowa is that the partisans shouting about it will drive them away.", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/youll-never-know-which-candidate-is-electable/", "published": "2020-02-07T11:00:32", "title": "You\u2019ll Never Know Which Candidate Is Electable", "text": "In a beige reception hall in a Des Moines suburb, over paper plates piled with the remains of a Monday morning continental breakfast, Sen. Bernie Sanders urged a packed house of Iowans to manifest their dreams. Imagine an America where cancer only kills you, rather than also rifling through your wallet. Visualize a future where no American child has to pay off her grandmother\u2019s student loans. Cynicism is high and more than a quarter of us believe the American Dream is unattainable, but Sanders\u2019s stump speech offered hope. \u201cEverything is impossible until it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. The crowd went wild.\n\nThis speech was about issues but it was also a pitch for the semi-improbable Sanders campaign, itself. Before you stands a 78-year-old Jewish man, a self-described democratic socialist and an independent interloper in the Democratic Party, who is making his second try at the presidency after 30 years as a professional gadfly.\n\nYet here we are, five weeks later, and that same old People\u2019s Grandpa is the candidate most likely to win a majority of delegates in the Democratic primary. Everything is impossible, after all, until it\u2019s not. But the pundits say Sanders is risky, and the pundits are honorable men. Already, you can find headlines full of concern that even if he was viable in Iowa, Sanders won\u2019t be able to win when it really counts. In other words: Sanders isn\u2019t electable.\n\nThis whole concept of electability is frustrating to voters like Brooks Vander Kopsa of Granger, Iowa. Standing in the back of the crowd, he told me who is and isn\u2019t electable makes no sense to him \u2014 but he\u2019s not even sure it matters. \u201cThere\u2019s all this talk about electability. \u2018Oh, this person is so much more electable than that person.\u2019 But when I look at policy and I look at track record, I don\u2019t know who is more electable than Bernie,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, electability. I guess I don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d\n\nTruth is, nobody does. For all the hands we\u2019ve wrung dry over it in recent elections, electability isn\u2019t a thing you can measure. It\u2019s subjective, not objective \u2014 which is why Sanders isn\u2019t the only candidate whose persona can be twisted one way to fit a narrative of unelectability, and another to tell a story of certain success. (Sen. Elizabeth Warren can attest to that.)\n\nPolitical scientists study electability, but electability ain\u2019t no science. Instead, researchers say, it\u2019s basically a layer of ex post facto rationalization that we slather over a stack of psychological biases, media influence and self-fulfilling poll prophecies. It\u2019s not bullshit, exactly; some people really are more likely to be elected than others. But the reasons behind it, and the ability to make assumptions based on it, well \u2026\n\n\u201c[Electability] is this vague, floppy concept,\u201d said Nichole Bauer, a professor of political communication at Louisiana State University. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who is electable until someone is elected.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m who you want to talk to,\u201d said Julie Brown of West Des Moines, arching her eyebrows and flashing the Elizabeth Warren button hidden under the flap of her canvas purse. She came to the Sanders rally with her teenage daughter, curious to understand why he was polling better than her favored candidate. As Sanders proxies worked the crowd, we huddled against a wall, talking about the ways electability and psychological biases overlap. \u201cI think he is electable and that frustrates me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt frustrates the female inside me. If Elizabeth Warren had had a heart attack, they would have put her six feet under.\u201d\n\nDetermining who is electable inevitably pits candidates against each other, especially in an election year when the top priority for primary voters \u2014 by a long shot \u2014 is nominating someone who can take down the sitting president. Brown is a voter who sees \u201celectability\u201d as basically a reflection of whether a candidate can clear the hurdles presented by the electorate\u2019s prejudices.\n\nMonths of talking about the primary \u2014 and wondering whether candidates will eventually win the general election \u2014 has made electability a hot buzzword of the 2020 election. But, scientists say, we\u2019ve not put as much work into clearly establishing what it is.\n\nWhen physicists suspect a thing exists, but can\u2019t observe it directly, they start studying the stuff around it. You can\u2019t see the particles, you can\u2019t look at the black hole, but you can see what happens when they crash into something else. And that\u2019s basically what political scientists have ended up doing with electability. To understand it better, researchers have looked at a couple of different kinds of social collisions: What voters like in a politician, and what those voters think other people like.\n\nAnd, in that way, Julie Brown isn\u2019t wrong about electability and bias, Bauer told me. Social scientists do use voters\u2019 biases to understand what electability is and what it might look like.\n\nA lot of this comes from experimental studies \u2014 contrived situations where researchers present participants with information about hypothetical candidates and ask them questions about how likeable that imaginary person is, or how much leadership ability they assume the candidate would possess. It\u2019s not the real world, but it does tell us something. Specifically, Bauer told me, voters\u2019 conception of who can get elected appears to be based on who has been elected in the past. \u201cAnd we always think about men,\u201d Bauer said.\n\nFor example, men generally have lower pitched voices than women \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot of research suggesting that people are more willing to vote for somebody whose voice pitch is more, well, manly. In a 2016 paper, researchers made recordings of five men and five women speaking the same sentence: \u201cI urge you to vote for me this November.\u201d They played these recordings for 393 men and 411 women, all of whom were participants in the Cooperative Congressional Election Study \u2014 a nationally representative survey that\u2019s used to track all kinds of voter behavior and opinions.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to listen to either five pairs of male voices or five pairs of female voices, and were asked which of each pair they\u2019d prefer to vote for. Across the board, participants preferred to vote for the candidate with the lower-pitched voice, regardless of if that candidate was male or female. And the effect was clearer for participants over 40 \u2014 you know, the people most likely to turn out to vote.\n\nBut it\u2019s not like someone\u2019s voice means much when it comes to actually governing. The people who did this study of voice pitch later went back and analyzed whether the voice pitch of sitting members of Congress correlated with their legislative activity, the holding of leadership positions or their influence in setting legislative priorities. Lo and behold, having a deeper voice does not make you a better politician. Voters just apparently sorta think it does.\n\nStudies like this run somewhat counter to actual electoral outcomes, though, said Cindy Kam, professor of political science at Vanderbilt University. Yes, studies suggest that voters hold female candidates to higher standards than their male counterparts \u2014 women who get elected to public office tend to be more qualified for the jobs they hold than men who get elected, for example. And women are significantly underrepresented in public office. But that\u2019s not the whole story because, while biases exist, women who do run seem to do about as well as men when it comes to getting elected.\n\nRacial bias, on the other hand, more clearly factors into outcomes of who actually wins elections, Kam and other experts said. Studies have found that white voters see black and Latino candidates as more ideologically extreme and less competent. There\u2019s also evidence white voters resist coming out to vote for black candidates even when they share an ideology with that candidate. And black women still rely on the black electorate to win their races.\n\nEven Barack Obama, who won the presidency, probably didn\u2019t get the votes a similarly positioned white candidate would have. In their 2012 book \u201cThe End of Race?\u201d political scientists Donald Kinder and Allison Dale-Riddle analyzed voter data from the 2008 presidential election. Based on party identification, you\u2019d have expected any candidate put forth by the Democratic party that year to pull in 55.5 percent of white voters. Instead, Obama got 43.3 percent of the white vote. He won the presidency, but with lower enthusiasm and turnout among whites than a similar white candidate would likely have had, Kam said.\n\nSo it\u2019s fair to say that our notion of electability is, at some level, related to our individual knee-jerk social biases \u2014 things like the color of a person\u2019s skin, or the way they present their gender to the world. We take those ingredients and we make assumptions about that person. We make assumptions about what other people might think about that person. We make assumptions about what researchers want us to say when they ask about our biases. We make a stew \u2014 reactions and reactions to reactions. It\u2019s virtually impossible to avoid bias in perceptions of electability, said Alan Abramowitz, professor of political science at Emory University. \u201cJust about anything that affects how you feel about a candidate could affect assessment of electability,\u201d he said.\n\nMedia narratives, in turn, often prey on these biases, which only makes them stronger. In lifting up electability as a marker of fitness, we\u2019ve inadvertently created a system that caters to whatever our imagined lowest common denominator might be. You might want to vote for a black, female candidate, goes the narrative \u2026 but other voters are racist and sexist and so you can\u2019t.\n\nBecause, of course, electability isn\u2019t just about individual feelings.\n\nWhen voters like Julie Brown and Brooks Vander Kopsa talk about whether Bernie Sanders is electable, they aren\u2019t really talking about their own feelings. They\u2019re talking about what they think other people feel, which is where polls come in.\n\n\u201cThe average person knows a little about politics, but not a ton,\u201d Stephen Utych, a professor of political science at Boise State University, said. And voters use polls as a source of information to fill in the gaps. \u201cIf I\u2019m a Republican and other Republicans don\u2019t like this person, I don\u2019t know what it is, but there must be something wrong with them,\u201d Utych said. We American voters really like to believe we\u2019re independent, Kam agreed, but the reality is that we take a lot of cues from the herd.\n\nBut polls can become a bit of an ouroboros. Kam and Utych\u2019s 2014 study found that candidates who were behind in the polls were rated less favorably by voters \u2014 and voters were less interested in seeking out information about those candidates.\n\nThe interaction of polls and media becomes its own self-fulfilling prophecy, Abramowitz and Utych both said. And candidates can shift the perception of how electable they are by striking back at the media and crafting their own narratives. In a 2018 study, the share of voters who, after reading a candidate\u2019s defense of their own electability, were willing to think the candidate could win the election more than doubled, rising from 15 percent to nearly 34 percent.\n\nThis early in the election season, there\u2019s still an opportunity to change the narrative \u2013 to grasp electability out of the jaws of defeat. And that\u2019s the paradox that leads candidates like Sanders to spend months traversing the early primary states \u2013 breakfast to breakfast, handshake to handshake. Winning Iowa allowed Barack Obama to craft a narrative of electability around himself in 2008. Conversely, Bill Clinton lost Iowa and took second place in New Hampshire in 1992. But, from that, his campaign was able to spin a narrative of being the \u201ccomeback kid\u201d, said Seth McKee, a professor of political science at Texas Tech University. \u201cI think Iowa and New Hampshire matter so much in how the media portray the horse race after the votes have been cast,\u201d he told me.\n\nBut building those narratives and harnessing those horses are dependent on the idea that voters have a good idea of what other voters want, or what other people\u2019s deal breakers might be. And the psychology gets very tricky here. Frankly, experts said, voters aren\u2019t great at knowing what\u2019s going on in their own heads, let alone those of strangers.\n\nA June 2019 Ipsos poll, for example, found that 74 percent of Democrats and Independents said they\u2019d be comfortable voting for a female president, but only 33 percent of those same people believed their neighbors would be as open-minded.\n\nThe effect captured in that Ipsos poll is so common, social scientists use it in their research to make sure participants aren\u2019t just blowing some woke-sounding smoke. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t stupid,\u201d Bauer told me. If you just ask who they like as a candidate, they\u2019ll figure out that you\u2019re trying to see if they\u2019re sexist. \u201cBut asking if you think they\u2019ll win is asking if you think other people will vote for that candidate. It takes social desirability pressure off the individual.\u201d But when polls turn up results like that, are they showing that Democrats are secretly more sexist than they let on? Are they showing Democrats are unfairly contemptuous of their fellow Americans? Maybe a little of both? It\u2019s hard to say, but it does demonstrate how hard it is to predict electability based on what you think other people think.\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue that electability is not a fixed idea. What makes a candidate likable to the nation, as a whole, is in flux \u2014 tracking, experts say, with hardening partisan lines.\n\nAnd voters see it, too. James Muhammad, a Californian visiting Iowa, was one of the other people I spoke to at the Sanders rally. When I asked him about electability, he just laughed. \u201cWas Trump electable?\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s a question academics are also asking. And it\u2019s one that\u2019s deeply tied up in attempts to understand what electability looks like to Democrats now. From what we can see in research on congressional races, which are more numerous, there\u2019s something about electability that is shifting. Something fundamental.\n\n\u201cI think there is an idea in the media of a centrist, usually white, not necessarily college educated voter who is the one at play and that probably has influenced the way the media is covering it,\u201d said Joshua Darr, a FiveThirtyEight contributor and professor of political science at Louisiana State University. That assumption of the power of the centrist voter is, to some extent, evidence based. Historically, being moderate and appealing to centrist voters was a great way to win congressional elections, Utych and Abramowitz both told me. But that\u2019s been changing. Abramowitz\u2019s analysis of the 2018 House elections turned up evidence that an incumbent candidate\u2019s past voting record \u2014 whether they were more moderate or not \u2014 didn\u2019t really make much of a difference in whether they won or lost, regardless of party. What\u2019s more, he told me, the number of moderate members in Congress has been falling for decades. Forty-eight percent of the 95th Congress (1977-79) fell within the moderate range of ideology, compared to just 16 percent of the 115th Congress (2017-19), Abramowitz found.\n\nIdeologues are elected more often than they used to be. Outsiders are elected more often, too. And the percentage of true swing voters is shrinking, Utych said. So does that mean someone like Sanders is more electable and someone like former Vice President Joe Biden is less electable? Electability here becomes a game of divining which group is more important to winning \u2014 swing voters or the partisan base. But that\u2019s no more accurate than trying to estimate how sexist your neighbors are. \u201cWhich segment is bigger \u2026 there\u2019s not great information on that,\u201d Utych said. \u201cAnything you say is just guessing.\u201d\n\nEven attempts to pin electability down subjectively leave you chasing your own tail, said Elizabeth Simas, a professor of political science at the University of Houston. We know from decades of research that voters have a tendency to line up their assumptions about who is electable line with the person they want to be elected. Maybe that means people just want to maintain some kind of cognitive consistency. \u201cBut it\u2019s just always going to be impossible to parse out whether someone supports a candidate because of electability, or if a candidate is perceived as electable because they are the preferred candidate,\u201d Simas said.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no better place to see that ambiguity than at a primary campaign rally. Skirting the edges of a cheering crowd, Brown and Vander Kopsa basically both want the same things \u2014 a candidate who cares about average people, a candidate who will be a game-changer and think outside the box. They both suspect other voters aren\u2019t engaged or doing the research necessary to know who meets those criteria. What they don\u2019t agree on is whether Bernie Sanders is inside the box, or out of it.", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-hiring-2020-summer-interns/", "published": "2020-01-30T23:26:49", "title": "We\u2019re Hiring 2020 Summer Interns", "text": "Exciting news!

And they did. We received many, many, many climate change questions. So many, in fact, that we\u2019re doing several different projects around them. You\u2019ve seen our columns on Who\u2019s Winning Climate Change? Today, we\u2019re diving into the mailbag for another edition of Climate Question from an Adult \u2013 a series that will explore the business, culture and chemistry behind your most pressing questions about global warming. Have a question? Send it to us!\n\n\u201cWhat are they measuring when they talk about limiting global average temperature change to less than 2 degrees? Is it air temp? Ocean temp? Where do they take the measurements?\u201d \u2013 Danny Kremer, Minnesota\n\nWhen I started researching the answer to Danny\u2019s question, I did not expect that it would lead to a crash course in the rapid advancement of bucket technology.\n\nYes, buckets. Literal buckets. The kind a bunch of sailors might put on a rope and throw over the side of a boat if they wanted to pull up some seawater and stick a thermometer in it.\n\nWhen we talk about the \u201cglobal average temperature\u201d and changes to that temperature, we are talking about a calculated average that incorporates measurements taken from both the land and the sea in locations scattered all over the world.\n\nThis week, the United States\u2019 National Climatic Data Center released its annual global climate report, which includes the latest estimate of how much hotter the planet was last year compared to the average 20th century temperature. When you see headlines that tell you 2019 was the second-hottest year on record, what you\u2019re actually seeing is the output of a massive data collection program \u2014 one that spans not just continents and governments, but a variety of technologies and more than a century of time. Behind that single number is a huge, complex story.\n\nAnd the evolution of buckets is a part of that tale. That\u2019s because one of the ways we take the temperature of the ocean is with the help of volunteers \u2014 sailors on random merchant and naval vessels who sign up to take daily readings during their journeys and report those to the United Kingdom\u2019s Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research. This program began more than 150 years ago, as part of the British Empire\u2019s efforts to map the warm-water currents that could efficiently carry colonialism from point A to point B.\n\nThe existence of this data is great news if you\u2019re a scientist who wants to know how the temperature of the ocean has changed over time. Unfortunately, it also means you have to account for changes in buckets. A water sample will stay warmer in a wooden bucket than in an uninsulated canvas one, John Kennedy, a climate monitoring and research scientist at the Hadley Centre, told me. So you can\u2019t directly compare a temperature taken in the 1880s (when wooden buckets were the norm) with one taken using the canvas buckets that became standard a few decades later. \u201cThe way we deal with buckets is that two of my former colleagues modeled how much heat a bucket loses in different weather conditions,\u201d Kennedy said. To normalize measurements across time, scientists use that model, as well as information like ship speed and wind speed. \u201cIt has to be retested over and over again,\u201d he told me.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just for the ocean temperatures. On the other side of the Atlantic, the U.S. government has been measuring the temperature of air since around the end of the Civil War, said Derek Arndt, chief of the climate monitoring section at the National Centers for Environmental Information, which manages the National Climatic Data Center. The measurements \u2014 originally the responsibility of surgeons at Army forts \u2014 were taken for the military and for farmers, Arndt said.\n\nBy the 1920s, that had grown into a nationwide network of volunteers \u2014 often those same farmers \u2014 who made daily records of temperature and precipitation. That network still exists today, Arndt told me, and it remains crucial, even though the National Weather Service is also taking more precise measurements more frequently, using automated weather stations.\n\nThat\u2019s because those automated stations are mostly located at airports. When they were first set up, that meant the stations were out in the sticks. But urban sprawl has pushed the city limits \u2014 and the heat islands that accompany cities \u2014 up to the edge of the taxiway. The robots may do a better job of monitoring changes in the weather, but the human volunteers, who are still mostly located in rural areas, make sure scientists know how much of a rising temperature is due to climate change \u2026 and how much is just cities expanding.\n\nIn fact, all the measurements that go into the global average temperature have similar redundancies built in. Measuring the temperature of the sea isn\u2019t just the responsibility of sailors with buckets \u2014 it\u2019s also done using satellites and again using floating thermometers that bob about in the world\u2019s oceans. Different groups of scientists study the same thing using different tools. The measurements they all produce help serve as a check on the others.\n\nThose bobbing thermometers, for example, are part of a project called Argo, which has released thousands of these little floating labs into the sea since 2000. Besides temperature, they also collect information on the saltiness of the water and other factors that help scientists study climate change. Measurements taken by Argo floats are going to be a lot more precise than measurements taken by non-scientists on a shipping vessel, but all the Argo floats are also sourced from the same electronics supplier, said Megan Scanderbeg, a research associate at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which helps maintain the Argo program. If something goes wrong in the manufacturing process, all the floats could report incorrect data. And since the Argo floats are designed to ride the waves wherever the ocean takes them and not be recaptured, that sort of problem would be hard to fix. Having multiple types of measurement serves as insurance.\n\nIt also helps protect against bias. While a lot of countries, including Japan and many European nations, have measurement programs similar to those run by the U.S. and the U.K., the countries most heavily involved in collecting this data have historically been centered on the Northern Hemisphere. Even historic ocean temperature measurements taken by sailing vessels were biased towards the northern half of the globe, because that\u2019s where the most heavily traveled trade routes were. Argo floats and satellite data helped give scientists a clearer view of what is happening all over the planet.\n\nAll of this data \u2014 ocean and air temperature measurements from satellites, robots and human volunteers \u2014 comes together at the World Meteorological Organization. It\u2019s a branch of the United Nations that coordinates the sharing of weather and climate data between 193 member states and territories. Data from around the globe goes in \u2014 climate change updates (and daily weather forecasts) come out.\n\nIt\u2019s also where much of the data the NCDC uses for its Global Climate Report comes from, Arndt told me. As one of the WMO\u2019s primary archives, his team takes reams of temperature readings, runs quality control tests, checks for things like changes in the location of a temperature station that might affect its readings and processes it all into an understandable summary of what is happening as the climate changes. From this, we know 2019 was 0.95 degrees Celsius hotter than the 20th century average and 1.15 degrees hotter than the pre-industrial average.

But the pros aren\u2019t the only ones reevaluating their relationship with the game. Now, studies are finding that parents of younger children are increasingly concerned about the long-term impacts of playing football.\n\nA national survey from 2015 found that 25 percent of parents do not let their kids play contact sports due to fear of concussions, while an Aspen Institute report recently found that participation in tackle football declined by 12 percent among children ages 6 to 12 between 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe research into the risks of youth football is still coming into shape, and there\u2019s disagreement about just how universal and severe the risks are. Some researchers think football is dangerous for everybody; others are finding evidence that some kids might be more predisposed to health consequences than others.\n\nIn the last two years, some researchers have shown that head hits in youth sports increase the risk of developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, an untreatable degenerative brain disease with symptoms ranging from memory loss to progressive dementia. Other studies have shown that the longer a person plays football, the higher the risk they have for developing symptoms associated with CTE. So, case closed, right?\n\nNo \u2014 football is not the only risk factor in developing symptoms of CTE. The same study that found an association between repetitive head impact and dementia in CTE also found that cardiovascular disease and dementia in CTE were correlated. And a separate study of some 10,000 people found no association between participation in contact sports and later cognitive decline or increase in symptoms of depression. \u201cWe don\u2019t see this being a massive epidemic across a huge swath of the population,\u201d said Adam Bohr, a researcher in integrative physiology at the University of Colorado Boulder and one of the co-authors of the study.\n\nBut that study isn\u2019t bulletproof either, as it checked back in with former high school athletes in early adulthood \u2014 so it could still be too early to see cognitive decline.\n\nAnd just to complicate things further, there is another study that tracked Wisconsin high school football players from the 1950s. Those former players, surveyed decades later in their 60s, did not have different cognitive or depression outcomes compared to nonplayers. Likewise, another recent survey of 35 retired NFL players over the age of 50 did not find a link between the number of concussions a player incurred and his cognitive decline.\n\nIt is difficult to parse the research, let alone conduct it: CTE can only be diagnosed post-mortem. Unless scientists are looking at the actual brains of former players, argue researchers such as Dr. Lee Goldstein of Boston University School of Medicine\u2019s CTE Center, they are not getting a complete picture.\n\nGoldstein argues the case against football and other high-impact sports is open and shut. \u201cAssociation is very clear. Risk increases with greater exposure, so if you don\u2019t want to have this disease or any risk of it, you shouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Goldstein said of playing football at any level.\n\nGoldstein and colleagues published a paper in the journal Brain in 2018 in which they found that mice subjected to different kinds of hits showed early signs of CTE, even without signs of concussion, implying subconcussive hits could also start the progression of the disease.\n\nC. Munro Cullum, a neuropsychologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, wants to understand what factors make some individuals more vulnerable to the negative outcomes of concussions. To do that, he and colleagues are partnering with youth football leagues in north Texas to collect data on concussions incurred during games. The project, called the Texas Sports Concussion Registry, aims to shed light on the connection between differences in how the sport is played and how that translates to concussion numbers and recovery.\n\nMost people with a concussion get back to normal within days or weeks, but \u201cthere is this significant minority that may have ongoing symptoms,\u201d Cullum said. Other researchers have found that a person\u2019s prior history of anxiety may increase the risk of a prolonged concussion recovery, or a family history of migraines might make someone more susceptible to experience post-concussion headaches.\n\nOthers are analyzing how all hits, not just concussions, affect players. Elizabeth Davenport, a researcher with the UT Southwestern radiology department, and her colleagues outfitted helmets for 60 high school players to measure every hit in a game. They then separated players into high- and low-impact groups and conducted fMRI scans to see how the groups differed.\n\nThose in the high-impact group saw an increased grey matter volume, which is not normal for that age group.\n\nIn the low-impact group of players \u2014 and in most normal teenage brains \u2014 grey matter volume is generally reduced or \u201cpruned\u201d throughout adolescence into the early 20s to make way for new synapses. \u201cYour brain is forming more highways and less just general run-of-the-mill tissue,\u201d Davenport said.\n\nIt may sound alarming that football players who receive more hits experience abnormal brain development, but Davenport cautions that researchers still don\u2019t know what the changes mean or if they are long term. She would like to be able to know if it\u2019s possible to draw the line at a certain number of head impacts before a player needs to recover. Similar measures already exist in baseball, for instance. Pitch counts help pitchers avoid rotator cuff injuries. Could football leagues eventually institute hit counts, after which players need to take a break? Would that break even allow the brain to heal?\n\nBut Goldstein doesn\u2019t buy it. There are just too many factors involved in individual health to pinpoint a single safety threshold in hits.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a universal threshold for the number of cigarettes, and if you cross that line then you have cancer. It doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d he said.\n\nThough parents are responding to that message \u2014 a study out of Arizona found a 17-point decrease in the percentage of parents willing to let their child play contact sports between 2019 and 2017 \u2014 football as an institution is not going anywhere. It\u2019s unlikely to be sued or legislated out of existence, at any level. A judge recently dismissed a lawsuit against Pop Warner, the largest youth football organization in the country, brought by two families of deceased players who claimed the organization hid the risks of youth football. Because so many factors affect brain health, it\u2019s hard to just pin something like a suicide, depression or erratic behavior on playing football.\n\nSo all the research leaves us more or less at this finding: Playing a sport where kids get hit over and over again affects their brain development. How much those brains are affected appears to depend on how long they play, how hard they play, and likely a multitude of other physiological, sociological and genetic factors that researchers are just beginning to analyze.\n\nSome researchers say it\u2019s too early in the concussion research to offer judgement calls on whether kids should play football.\n\n\u201cI would want more information, as a parent, to make a better-informed decision and that\u2019s where these studies come into play,\u201d Davenport said.\n\nBut in his work examining the brains of dead teenagers, Goldstein has seen enough.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recommend it as a physician, I don\u2019t recommend it as a father and I don\u2019t recommend it as a scientist,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d", "author": ["Leah Shaffer"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-of-our-best-work-from-2019/", "published": "2019-12-30T13:27:40", "title": "Some Of Our Best Work From 2019", "text": "Some Of Our Best Work From 2019 Things we love that you might have missed.\n\nFor a newsroom like FiveThirtyEight\u2019s, 2019 may as well been part of 2020.

It Might Go A Long Way.", "text": "The Dickey Amendment is dead. Or, maybe it\u2019s more that it has eroded into a shadow of what it once was. First passed into law in 1996, the Amendment is widely credited with ending federal funding of gun violence research in the United States. But while Dickey is technically still on the books, Democrats have chipped away at its power over the last couple years \u2014 first with an official clarification that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can study gun violence, and now a bipartisan agreement to provide $25 million of actual funding to back that up.\n\nThat news is straightforward enough. But news outlets around the country have framed this week\u2019s spending deal \u2014 which still needs to be approved by the Senate and President Trump \u2014 as potentially the first federal funding for gun violence research in 20 years. They\u2019re wrong. As we reported last month, the Dickey Amendment isn\u2019t a solid wall preventing all gun violence research from happening; it\u2019s more of a scarecrow. The federal government has funded gun violence studies all along, mostly through agencies such as the Department of Justice.\n\nMeanwhile, the $25 million (half of what Democrats originally asked for) is basically pennies for the guy. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s more a symbolic victory, in so much as they could finally make the announcement that the embargo had been lifted,\u201d said James Densley, a professor of criminal justice at Minnesota\u2019s Metropolitan State University. His research includes developing a database of mass shootings funded by the National Institute of Justice, the research agency serving the Department of Justice.\n\nBut there is more to this than mere symbolism. The kind of research the CDC and NIH are most likely to support is a study that treats gun violence as a public health issue. That\u2019s no different than the way those agencies often approach other kinds of fatal injuries, such as car crashes, Densley told me. But that approach is controversial \u2014 the whole reason the Dickey Amendment exists is to block this kind of research. And looking at guns from a public health perspective does change how researchers approach violence.\n\nTraditionally, gun violence research has been done through a criminal justice lens, Densley said. That basically means the focus tends to get narrowed to the use of guns in crime or by convicted criminals. Researchers ask questions like, \u201chow do firearms get into the hands of felons?\u201d\n\nBut gun violence is something that happens outside a criminal context, too. Suicide, the biggest cause of gun deaths in this country, is not the same as a robbery, and the people who use guns to kill themselves are often legal gun owners. Likewise, the causes of gun violence can have deeper roots than \u201cneeded a weapon to commit a crime.\u201d The impacts of that violence can extend beyond the individuals who held (or were physically harmed by) the weapon.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the public health framework comes in, Densley said. Research done in this way looks for clusters of violence the same way you might look for cancer clusters or outbreaks of a virus. Like that kind of epidemiology, public health research looks for what puts certain people and places more at risk \u2014 and what can be done to reduce those risks. Public health research asks questions about how gun violence in a community affects other kinds of risks \u2014 stress-related illnesses, for instance, or educational outcomes. This approach makes a lot of sense to many doctors and social scientists, but it\u2019s controversial because groups like the National Rifle Association see it as a backdoor to push through limits on legal gun ownership that have more to do with ideology than data.\n\nBut even researchers like Densley, whose work exists squarely in the criminal justice context, say the public health perspective is important to prevent violence. For example, he said, the teens who go on to become school shooters often steal improperly secured guns from their parents or borrow guns from other legal owners. \u201cThat speaks to the need for a public health campaign,\u201d he told me. \u201cLike friends don\u2019t let friends drive drunk. You can apply that to the idea friends don\u2019t let friends borrow guns.\u201d", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/in-american-politics-everyones-a-cynic/", "published": "2019-12-17T11:00:54", "title": "In American Politics, Everyone\u2019s A Cynic", "text": "Everybody is cynical and few people are changing their minds. That\u2019s the takeaway from the House\u2019s impeachment hearings. (Well, that and Steve Castor\u2019s unconventional taste in briefcases.) It\u2019s the sort of national attitude that you might suspect would inspire political apathy. If you think all politicians are crooked do-nothings, you might care less what they do.\n\nBut a half-century of research \u2014 and an even longer slide into pessimism among the American electorate \u2014 suggests that any cynicism following the impeachment hearing isn\u2019t likely to make voters stay home in 2020. That was the old theory, born in the post-Watergate days when trust in politics was as low and heavy as a funk bassline, said Jack Citrin, professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. But it never bore out. Instead, Citrin and other experts say cynicism actually seems to be a political motivator, increasing both activism and voter turnout. But while we often broadly think of those as Good Things for Democracy, they don\u2019t necessarily portend a shiny, hopeful political future.\n\nAmericans are definitely cynical about politics. The American National Election Studies survey, which has tracked American opinion since 1958, includes a \u201ctrust index\u201d combining the results of four questions about voters perceptions of government and politicians into a single score.\n\nThe average trust score in 2016 was 17, the lowest ever recorded. Although these questions are about trust, they serve as a proxy for understanding cynicism because political scientists think of those two things as opposites. Cynicism goes up as trust goes down, or vice versa.\n\nNow, we weren\u2019t always this dark. Scrub away the black eyeliner and you\u2019ll find a country that once got an average score of 61, back in 1966. Same survey. Same questions. And you see the same trend line in other measures of trust, such as Pew data that tracks the percentage of Americans who agree that the federal government will \u201cdo what is right.\u201d Half a century ago, 77 percent of us had high hopes for our elected officials. Since then, things have been on a downward slide, with two clear exceptions.\n\nOne came during the early Reagan years, ending about the time the Iran-Contra Affair became public. The other happened over the course of the latter Clinton years, peaking after 9/11, then rapidly falling again. Today, trust in the government is so low that one expert I spoke to \u2014 a Berkeley political scientist named Laura Stoker \u2014 said she had a hard time imagining how it could actually fall further. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty much at the floor,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty darn low.\u201d\n\nAnd, yet, voter participation has not followed a similar trend. \u201cI\u2019d say cynics generally aren\u2019t apathetic,\u201d said Sanne Rijkhoff, a professor of political science at Texas A&M, Corpus Cristi. \u201cIf you really don\u2019t like something, that implies a certain level of passion about it.\u201d Despite our historically low levels of political trust, Americans join in political movements and activism at staggeringly high rates. Back in 2008, Pew found that 63 percent of Americans had joined in some kind of political or civic activism. A similar survey by the same organization in 2012 found that 72 percent of us were out there, doing something to shape a political system we mostly hate. And Logan Dancey, a professor of government at Wesleyan University, even found evidence that the more cynical people are, the more likely they are to take a political scandal seriously, see wrongdoing, and want politicians to be held accountable.\n\nSo does that mean cynicism serves the public good? Or, alternately, if you\u2019re the Democrats, does that mean you want the public more cynical after the impeachment hearings because they might be more likely to want impeachment to happen?\n\nErrrr, not exactly, Citrin said. Some cynicism is good, he said. Think of it as skepticism, in that case. You probably don\u2019t want a public that is happy to just smile and approve of everything their elected representatives do.\n\nBut, he told me, there is a point where the downsides of cynicism swamp the benefits. And we probably hit that point back in the days of bell bottoms and bad moustaches. Growth in cynicism is associated with increased support for outsider and extremist candidates willing to break political taboos. It\u2019s associated with decreased support for incumbents. It\u2019s associated with growing distrust between politicians, themselves, which makes them less likely to work together to solve problems. Voters may get more active as they get cynical, but their politicians become less active, which just contributes to a cycle that drives even more cynicism, Stoker said.\n\nUnsurprisingly cynicism is also associated with decreased support for large-scale government programs, such as healthcare reform, public education, or climate change adaptation. That\u2019s not a good sign for any Democrats trying to use 2020 to usher in a new New Deal.\n\nIn fact, cynicism is a highly partisan thing, in and of itself. The American public may be able to join hands and sing together in the spirit of disillusionment and doubt, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re united by it. If you break people down by their party affiliation, you see an increase in trust when their party of choice is in power, a decrease when that party loses power, and vice versa. \u201cThat lessened trust among those who don\u2019t hold power, that\u2019s fueling the aggregate decline [in trust],\u201d Stoker told me.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the lowest levels of trust come from independents \u2014 who never get to enjoy being the party in power. Stoker thinks the growth in independent-identified voters is actually one of the trends fueling the growth of cynicism.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the political scientists I spoke with have no idea how you fix this. The initial plummet in trust looks like an Olympic ski jump preceding Watergate that heads far down the mountain after. Early on, experts thought it would rebound once the government was able to demonstrate it could \u201cdo the right thing\u201d \u2014 essentially show it could be trusted, after all. \u201cBut what do you mean by doing the right thing?\u201d Rijkhoff said. The interactions between growing partisan rancor and the effects of cynicism, itself, have combined to make reversing extreme cynicism damn near impossible.\n\nOn the plus side, though, maybe that means the recent impeachment hearings won\u2019t make things any worse. \u201cWatergate was a shock to the nation,\u201d Stoker said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this will have any consequences on trust in government whatsoever.\u201d", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/does-knowing-whom-others-might-vote-for-change-whom-youll-vote-for/", "published": "2019-12-05T11:00:19", "title": "Does Knowing Whom Others Might Vote For Change Whom You\u2019ll Vote For?", "text": "When a presidential race that was supposed to be won by a mainstream moderate instead ends being captured by a far-right gadfly, you better believe pollsters are gonna get some scrutiny. But when this situation took place in the first round of French elections in 2002, bumping the incumbent prime minister from the final round, it wasn\u2019t just the failure of prediction that led to a polling protest. Instead, people were concerned that opinion polling, itself, had caused the outcome.\n\nTwenty-four years earlier, France had muzzled opinion polling, banning the publication of poll results for a week before any election out of fear that voters were following the polls, rather than the other way around. That changed in 2001, and the 2002 election was the first time since the 1970s that French voters had been able to make their choice knowing what their neighbors were likely planning to do.\n\nAs hard as it may be for some of us to imagine (especially readers of this website), laws limiting when opinion polls can be published before an election are pretty common. Of the 216 countries whose election rules are tracked by the United Nations-backed Electoral Knowledge Network, 92 have some kind of regulated blackout period where polls cannot be published. Even after its 2002 rule change, France still has a 24-hour blackout period before the vote. Experts say most of these laws are based around the same premise: Polls can influence votes. If you know that most of your fellow citizens are planning to pick a specific candidate, you might decide to be part of the winning team. If you know the person you\u2019d pick is so far ahead that there\u2019s no chance of them losing, maybe you\u2019ll chill out and stay home on election day.\n\nElection poll blackouts are common outside the U.S. Number of countries per opinion poll blackout duration Length of Poll Blackout Number of Countries 1 day before election 21 \u2013 \u2013 2-3 days 31 \u2013 \u2013 4-5 days 11 \u2013 \u2013 6-7 days 8 \u2013 \u2013 8-9 days 2 \u2013 \u2013 10 or more days 19 \u2013 \u2013 Not applicable* 33 \u2013 \u2013 No information available 91 \u2013 \u2013 * \u201cNot applicable\u201d includes countries that have no regulations limiting the publication of polls, as well as countries that don\u2019t conduct public polling and ones that don\u2019t have elections. Source: The ACE Electoral Knowledge Network\n\nBut despite the power this fear has to shape law and fuel media narratives, the evidence supporting it is complex. Polls probably do influence how people vote in some situations, experts say. But it\u2019s not anything like a universal, definitive effect. What\u2019s more, some of them told me they aren\u2019t sure that would be a bad thing. The question isn\u2019t just whether polls determine outcomes, it\u2019s also a debate over how people should decide their vote.\n\nLooking through the published research on how polling might influence elections, the first thing you find is that the risk has a name \u2014 \u201cthe bandwagon effect.\u201d The second thing you find is that paper after paper seeks to figure out if the bandwagon effect is real. How could a thing have a name but still need proof of its existence? \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to get at and isolate this effect,\u201d said Tom van der Meer, a professor of social and behavioral sciences at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.\n\nLike many social science questions where the outcome is often determined by interactions between more than one factor, this is not an easy effect to study. Laboratory settings tend to show a bandwagon effect in action, van der Meer said. But these are spaces where research subjects look at pretend poll results and place hypothetical votes, which may not reflect the real world. Observational studies \u2014 looking at the outcomes of real elections \u2014 are thickets of potential causal factors, nearly impossible to hack your way through. How do you determine whether it was the polls themselves that shifted the vote, or the polls that shaped media coverage that, in turn, shifted the vote? You can see the problem.\n\nBut, on the whole, experts say the bandwagon is real. How real, though, depends on the context. \u201cAre we talking about turnout, voting for a particular candidate, support for an issue \u2026?\u201d said Todd Hartman, a professor of quantitative social science at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom. \u201cDepending on what area you\u2019re talking about, the effects are stronger or weaker.\u201d\n\nFor example, in 2013, researchers used a change in French law to get an idea of the potential impact of polls on voter turnout. Prior to 2005, citizens of France who lived in territories west of the country didn\u2019t get to vote until after the mainland election had ended. Thus, they had the chance to see exit polls before they even went to cast their ballots. That changed after 2005, so researchers could compare several years worth of elections and see how knowledge of the presumed winner changed voter behavior. The result: After 2005, there was a nearly 12 percentage point increase in voter turnout. Far more people in those overseas territories voted when they didn\u2019t already know who the winner was \u2014 a finding that has big implications for countries like the United States, where time zone differences mean voters in one part of the country can see the completed exit polls from earlier in the day.\n\nBut the effects aren\u2019t always that distinct. A different paper, published in 2016, involved a series of experiments that sorted more than 20,000 Dutch voters into groups that were then exposed to different kinds of polling data. Surveys showed that the people given just poll numbers didn\u2019t change their vote intention at all \u2014 they looked no different than the group that received no polling information. But a third group, which was presented with a narrative-style interpretation of the polls showing one party gaining ground over time, did change their intended vote, becoming 2 percentage points more likely than the control group to vote for the party that was surging. That\u2019s a small effect, but it could matter in a tight race.\n\nAnother study showed that American voters with strong partisan preferences alter their votes to conform to opinion poll results that show what their preferred party likes or doesn\u2019t like \u2014 but won\u2019t do the same to match overall American opinion. Likewise, while polls won\u2019t affect every voter, they can, in aggregate, become self-fulfilling prophecies that heighten how people feel about a given issue.\n\nBut while the experts I spoke to generally agreed that bandwagon effects exist under certain conditions, they weren\u2019t as certain about the implications of those effects and what, if anything, we should do about it. They even disagreed with themselves at times. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard question,\u201d said Neil Malhotra, professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\nOn the one hand, he told me, you don\u2019t want people making choices in elections based on the kind of herding behavior that leads to a mediocre restaurant having a line down the block for no reason other than that there\u2019s always a line there. Sometimes, popularity isn\u2019t actually a proxy for quality. On the other hand, polls can provide voters with valuable information that allows them to vote strategically, especially in primaries where you\u2019re less likely to know a lot about the candidates. Say you\u2019re a Democratic primary voter who likes both Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. A poll can help you decide which of those two candidates is most likely to benefit from your vote.\n\nHartman was also conflicted. \u201cPeople will use whatever information is available to them,\u201d he said. \u201cIn an ideal democracy, we\u2019d like to see people making decisions based on the issue platforms. But we also know that many voters are low-information voters, and they\u2019re going to use whatever cues they can to sort out which candidate to vote for.\u201d Those might be endorsements. It might be party affiliation. They might be poll results. In that sense, bandwagons aren\u2019t exactly good or bad. They just exist.\n\nWhich means the media has a large role to play in how voters hear about which bandwagons to jump on. Van der Meer\u2019s research on those Dutch voters suggests that raw information doesn\u2019t seem to shift votes, but narratives about the information do. In that case, he said, the media needs to be extra careful how it presents polling data.\n\nWhich, of course, brings FiveThirtyEight into the mix. As a publication that presents a lot of polling data to the public, we\u2019re as much a part of this story as we are reporters of it. Nate Silver, our editor in chief, certainly thinks about bandwagons. But he doesn\u2019t consider them to be that big of a deal, he told me. That\u2019s because Silver doesn\u2019t really see the choice as being between poll-informed voting and policy-informed voting. \u201cWithout polling, there\u2019s a vacuum filled by punditry and media assumptions,\u201d he said. Banning polls doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people vote smarter. In fact, from Silver\u2019s perspective, it means they\u2019re likely to vote even dumber \u2014 basing a choice on speculation instead of data.\n\nIn the end, the question of whether polls influence voters might be less important than the question of whether voters have a right to access information they want. Consider, again, the 2002 French election. Analysis after the fact suggests that polling results did make a difference in that upset \u2014 leading voters to assume a mainstream runoff was so certain that it was safe to cast a ballot for a more extremist candidate, just to send a message to the winners. If enough people do that, their assumptions about who the winners will be won\u2019t be accurate.\n\nBut that outcome didn\u2019t make the French switch back to a longer poll blackout. They couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s because the whole reason the blackout was shortened was that the country\u2019s highest court found it to be an infringement of an article of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prevents public authorities from interfering with people sharing their opinions. Polls may well have changed the outcome of an election in France. But that was a choice the voters had the right to make.", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-gettin-hot-in-here-so-be-a-sawtail-fish/", "published": "2019-11-18T14:30:57", "title": "Is This Fish Winning Climate Change?", "text": "This summer, we asked readers to send us their climate change questions. And they did. We received many, many, many climate change questions. So many, in fact, that we\u2019re doing several different projects around them. The main column, Climate Questions from an Adult, explores the business, culture and chemistry behind your pressing climate queries. Today, in another edition of our second column, Who\u2019s Winning Climate Change, we\u2019re diving into the strange stories and complex choices that arise when a warmer planet isn\u2019t 100 percent terrible for everyone.\n\n\u201cThere are many articles about how climate change has been detrimental to animal habitat, but I wonder, are there any animals that will benefit from climate change that pose no risk to humans, so not mosquitoes, ticks or any other disease vector?\u201d \u2014 Roberto Romero, California.\n\nPicture a tropical fish \u2014 a shimmery pancake of an animal with an Instagram pucker and a penchant for nibbling the algae off tropical coral. In the warm waters of northeastern Australia, fish just like this, called sawtails, have long lived as part of the ecosystem of the Great Barrier Reef. Unfortunately for them, the reef is dying, bleaching like a cattle skull in the sun as climate change makes the surrounding water a little too warm.\n\nNow picture a kelp forest \u2014 seaweed redwoods lazily undulating in the cool ocean current of southeast Australia. Another victim of climate change, the kelp are struggling to survive the voracious sawtails that have swum in on newly warmer currents. The fish nibble, and they nibble, until there\u2019s nothing left of the kelp to grow back. In their wake, corals cling to the freshly exposed rocks. New reefs begin to grow.\n\n\u201cI guess my point is that it\u2019s difficult to say what is a winner and what is a loser,\u201d said Brett Scheffers, a professor of wildlife ecology and conservation at the University of Florida. The sawtail is a loser in its native habitat \u2014 and a winner in the one it\u2019s slowly colonizing someplace else. And it\u2019s not alone. All over the world, animals and plants are being forced to respond to a changing climate. Some of those species will clearly and decisively lose. But many others, like the sawtail, have tourney stats that are a little harder to parse. Whether they\u2019re winning depends on when you assess them and where they are \u2014 and it depends on how humans respond to them.\n\nFrom polar bears to sea turtles, loser species often get all the attention, said Stephen Hamilton, professor of ecology at Michigan State. Meanwhile, the species that look like winners also often look like a lot of bad news: Think about tropical dengue-carrying mosquitoes or tree-killing gypsy moths slouching northward.\n\nBut there really are some animals and plants that are surviving and thriving, or are projected to, as the world warms. And they aren\u2019t all invasive species or creatures that seem to malignly have it in for the human race, said Cascade Sorte, a professor of ecology at the University of California, Irvine. Instead, she told me, the species that seem destined for success tend to fall into one of two categories: Things that can take a pounding and get back up like they\u2019re trying to steal the title from Apollo Creed \u2014 and things that can reproduce really, really fast.\n\nThose skills are important because climate change isn\u2019t a single shift from one condition to another. \u201cThere\u2019s no equilibrium,\u201d Hamilton said. No \u201cnew normal\u201d that we will reach and stabilize at. Instead, you\u2019re talking about ongoing change.\n\nTo do well under those conditions, a species has to be extremely flexible. There are a couple key traits that help. Sorte used two species that were surviving happily in the warming waters of the Gulf of Maine as her examples. If a species is hardy, it can handle living on the edges of its comfortable habitat, like the barnacles that live high on coastal rocks and can survive being exposed to the air and blazing sun for long periods. If it reproduces fast, it can move into a new environment and establish itself more easily, like thin-bladed sea lettuce that can throw down roots, grow quickly and spread.\n\nGranted, many of the classic invasive species fit this description, since they\u2019ve had to adapt to a new climate somewhere along the way. But that doesn\u2019t mean all species that are winning climate change are necessarily invasive \u2014 at least not in the same sense as something like kudzu or the emerald ash borer, both species that were brought by humans (whether intentionally or accidentally) to a new environment where they proceeded to take over. In fact, some studies show that climate change-related droughts in the southwest United States could actually favor native species, Sorte said, because those species were already well adapted to surviving on little water. True invasives aren\u2019t.\n\nInstead, Scheffers said, a lot of the species that are winning climate change are doing so as part of what he calls \u201cmass redistribution\u201d \u2014 animals and plants that move, on their own accord, as their own native environment also moves. Consider the lobster. Over the course of about 20 years, the lobster harvest in southern New England and New York all but collapsed \u2014 with the catch falling by 97 percent from 1996 to 2014. Meanwhile, in Maine, where the water is still a comfortable lobster temperature, the catch rose by 219 percent in roughly the same time period.\n\nThe water got warmer, and the lobsters moved.\n\nWhether that counts as winning is complex, though. The lobster species is doing fine. So from their perspective: solid win. Same for the Maine fishermen who ended up with a lobster boom. But the Gulf of Maine Lobster Paradise is not a constant that will now stick around forever. Already, ideal temperatures (and lobsters) are moving to Canadian waters. Any fishing industry left behind by the lobsters\u2019 scrappy march toward survival is unlikely to feel particularly blessed. And, Scheffers said, we know very little about interactions between species as these migrations happen. Are there any species being displaced by lobsters in the same way Australian sawtails are devouring kelp forests? Hard to say.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as species migrate and redistribute themselves as a means of adaptation, they might run headlong into humans\u2019 difficulty adjusting to change. Scheffers talked about the plight of the brown cowbird, a species native to North America that moved eastward across the continent in response to forest clearing and other human-induced environmental changes. A lot of people think of them as invasive, he said, and treat them as such \u2014 including intentionally culling the birds to protect native species.\n\nNow imagine what might happen as plants and animals native to Mexico start to follow the temperatures they\u2019re adapted to northward. What happens if they displace or outcompete the plants and animals that were already here? \u201cWill we call them invasive?\u201d Scheffers asked. A species could adapt to climate change only to end up being harmed by the people in their new environment. \u201cIf we suddenly treat them like cowbirds, they have no protection and we cull them, it creates a lot of complications,\u201d Scheffers said.\n\nThat\u2019s just one of the things that makes determining climate winners and losers tough all around. Win/lose, good/bad \u2014 those aren\u2019t science things. Those are value judgements humans make individually, and subjectively, Sorte said. After all, the concept of an ambiguous climate win isn\u2019t limited to fish on the Great Barrier Reef. \u201cImagine it snows less,\u201d Sorte said. \u201cThat\u2019s bad if you love to ski. But it\u2019s good if you don\u2019t like shoveling the drive.\u201d Same with the animals.", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-hiring-a-copy-chief-2/", "published": "2019-11-17T21:45:18", "title": "We\u2019re Hiring A Copy Chief", "text": "FiveThirtyEight is hiring a copy chief, a senior editor who will oversee the flow and production of articles.

I can\u2019t really tell you exactly. You\u2019d think gunshot injuries would be easy to count, but as we\u2019ve reported in the past, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls its own estimates \u201cunstable and potentially unreliable.\u201d The range of uncertainty has gotten so large that the agency removed the most recent two years\u2019 worth of firearm injury data from its website.\n\nBut other people are counting. On Monday, the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety released its own non-fatal shooting estimates. Pulling from existing data that shows 73,330 Americans are shot and injured every year, Everytown applied its own analysis to turn that big number into more detailed demographic lessons \u2014 like the fact that rural and urban counties have about the same rate of gun injuries per 100,000 people. Overall, the estimated number of people shot and not killed in this country is twice as many are estimated to be killed by guns each year in the U.S.\n\nBut Everytown for Gun Safety is an advocacy organization \u2014 one that is explicitly in favor of gun control laws. Can it effectively pick up the federal government\u2019s slack in the field of gun violence research?\n\nTo understand the void Everytown is trying to fill, we need to revisit what created the void. These conversations inevitably drift towards the Dickey Amendment, a rider to a 1996 spending bill that banned the use of federal money to \u201cadvocate or promote gun control.\u201d The language was vague. The effects were far-reaching \u2014 politicians, gun control advocates and scientists have all said the amendment had a chilling effect on gun-related research at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health. Even when Congress officially clarified that the Dickey Amendment didn\u2019t mean the CDC couldn\u2019t study gun violence, they didn\u2019t provide funding to make that research happen. In 2012, for example, the CDC had $100,000 to spend on gun violence. That can\u2019t even buy you a house in D.C.\n\nBut the Dickey Amendment didn\u2019t cut off funding of gun violence research everywhere. Several other federal agencies fund this science, said James Densley, a professor of criminal justice at Minnesota\u2019s Metropolitan State University. His research includes developing a database of mass shootings funded by the National Institute of Justice, the research and development agency serving the Department of Justice.\n\nFederal funding definitely makes a difference, Densley told me. On his own, he doesn\u2019t have the authority to ask for certain types of information and resources. But with the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of his federal grant number, he can convince law enforcement and other official agencies to let him have access to crucial data. Private foundations also fund gun violence research, though Densley said those grants are often one-time payouts made by an organization before it moves on to other do-gooding.\n\nIn fact, the numbers Everytown released Monday came from (or, rather, were produced through analysis of) data collected by the Department of Health and Human Services. This database is basically a collection of hospital emergency room intake and discharge forms sampled from 20 percent of the hospitals in the country. It\u2019s not specifically aimed at studying gun violence, but it can be used that way. And it typifies the kind of large-scale, multi-state data collection that basically requires the federal government\u2019s involvement to get done.\n\nInstead of attempting to do better data collection on its own, with fewer resources and less social capital, groups like Everytown often find themselves adding analytical value to federal data. The HHS database, for instance, has a public portal (we\u2019ve used it), but it\u2019s not great for producing the kind of detailed demographics Everytown thought were missing from public knowledge. So while the overall number of gun injuries comes directly from HHS, Everytown (like other researchers) had to buy the data and do the analysis themselves to pull out things like income and ages of people getting shot, said Sarah Burd-Sharps, Everytown\u2019s research director. Everyone would be better off, she told me, if the CDC just had the funding to improve their injury survey and make detailed gun violence data reliable and accessible to begin with.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, other experts said, we\u2019d be better off if the analysis wasn\u2019t coming from Everytown. Statistics released by the CDC are considered the gold standard, said Deb Azrael, who works at the Harvard Youth Violence Prevention Center, because of that whole \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d thing. \u201cNot that federal data would be perfect,\u201d Azrael said. \u201cBut when I see data from Everytown or The Trace, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing. Maybe nothing. But if I put it in a paper, I can guarantee that a reviewer would push back and say, \u2018How do you know this is any good?\u2019\u201d And that\u2019s even before you get to the political pushback. If you\u2019re worried about bias in favor of gun control at the CDC, you\u2019re really gonna hate the priors at Everytown.\n\nSo no, nonprofits can\u2019t replace the federal government on gun violence research. But, surprisingly, experts also told me that the Dickey Amendment is a bad bogeyman to fear. Remember, it didn\u2019t end all federal funding of gun research. Nor, said Azrael and Densley, is that particular amendment the main thing holding back funding.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely true that some in Washington are worried about what will happen if the government funds gun violence research, Azrael told me. And she thinks that\u2019s a huge problem. She and Densley both think federal funding is as necessary to their field of research as it is to the scientists trying to cure cancer. \u201cBut the specter of, \u2018Oh, if only we could get rid of Dickey the world would change drastically.\u2019 That\u2019s overplayed,\u201d she said.", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-understand-natural-disasters-in-a-climate-change-age/", "published": "2019-10-31T16:24:40", "title": "How To Understand Natural Disasters In A Climate Change Age", "text": "Fires, floods, polar vortexes and hurricanes \u2014 every season brings another disaster seemingly linked to climate change. But natural disasters happened before climate change, too. So how are we supposed to know which disasters are fated because of the stars, and which are fated because of 100 years of global CO2 emissions?\n\nSince the calamities aren\u2019t going to stop anytime soon, we figured it\u2019d be helpful to give you a guide for how to think empirically about disaster news in a climate change era. We asked some climate scientists what they think the headlines get wrong or leave out. They offered four tips for thinking about natural disasters and climate change \u2014 tips they say can make the difference between feeling hopeless about the future and finding ways to change it.\n\n1) No disaster is actually \u201cnatural\u201d\n\nOr, at least, not purely natural, said Chris Field, an environmental scientist who was co-chair of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group. He\u2019s literally written the book (well, the report) on climate change and disasters, and said that the \u201cdisaster\u201d label is about what happens when nature and people meet \u2014 not what nature does, alone. A hurricane that strikes a sparsely populated strip of coastline isn\u2019t the same as one that hits a major metropolis. A heat wave in a region that\u2019s used to dealing with high temperatures is much less of a disaster than the same heat in a place where almost no one has central air. Thinking about the \u201cnatural\u201d and the \u201cdisaster\u201d as two separate things is important, experts told me, because it changes the way we respond. If our risks are about more than just what the climate and the weather does, that means there are more ways to reduce our risks. It\u2019s not an all-or-nothing situation where we have to either stop climate change or encounter doom.\n\n2) Climate change is \u201ca\u201d cause of disasters, not \u201cthe\u201d cause\n\nBehind every natural event that becomes a disaster is a tangle of causes \u2014 some natural, some man-made. Climate change might be a part of it, but it\u2019s never the only thing going on. \u201cWhen I look at any of these events and see the headlines, it\u2019s almost always a situation where [the disaster] is caused by natural variability \u2026 and the climate change part of it is making it worse,\u201d said Lisa Goddard, director of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University. For example, drought in the West is linked to an increased risk of wildfire, but the droughts we\u2019ve seen over the last couple decades are natural cycles, Goddard said. Combine those with climate-change induced higher average temperatures, though, and you\u2019ve got a natural problem made bigger by human-caused change. This kind of thing is what makes makes climate communication messy. You want people to take the impacts of climate change seriously. At the same time, the risks of a natural disaster are about more than just carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere.\n\n3) Don\u2019t ask \u201chow much,\u201d ask \u201chow likely\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to know how much of a disaster is caused by climate change. And that\u2019s the wrong question to even ask, Goddard said. Instead, try and think about whether climate change has increased the likelihood or severity of a type of disaster overall, said Melissa Allen-Dumas, a researcher at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory who focuses on climate change and critical infrastructure. That\u2019s because the answer to that question actually has an impact on how people and communities respond after a disaster strikes. Knowing whether or not a particular hurricane would have happened if not for climate change doesn\u2019t necessarily affect how you rebuild. Knowing that climate change is raising the sea level and increasing the likelihood of coastal flooding, however, should.\n\n4) When all else fails, think in terms of vulnerability\n\nDisasters don\u2019t take place in a vacuum \u2014 their devastation depends on the vulnerability of the communities they affect. The consequences of a drought and high temperatures will be less severe if forests have been managed in a healthy way and the wilderness isn\u2019t full of aging power lines. When you read about climate change disasters, pay attention to the issues that make communities more or less vulnerable. Those vulnerabilities are, in some cases, preventable ones. The way you think about a given disaster (and future possible disasters) changes if you know that.\n\nUnderstanding vulnerability is also important to understanding the global impacts of climate change. When we talk about developing countries being more at risk from climate change, what we\u2019re talking about is the vulnerability \u2014 and whether or not they have the resources to adapt. If you look purely at the monetary value, somebody who owns a house in Malibu may be more at risk from a climate change-associated natural disaster than a farmer in Bangladesh. But ultimately, Field said, it\u2019s the farmer who has more to lose. Insurance, having extra money in the bank, having access to emergency services, and even just having the ability to move someplace else \u2014 all those things affect vulnerability, which, in turn, affects how big of a disaster a natural event turns out to be.", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-carbon-capture-hasnt-saved-us-from-climate-change-yet/", "published": "2019-10-30T14:20:07", "title": "Why Carbon Capture Hasn\u2019t Saved Us From Climate Change Yet", "text": "This summer, we asked readers to send us their climate change questions. And they did. We received many, many, many climate change questions. So many, in fact, that we\u2019re doing several different projects around them. You\u2019ve already seen the first of our columns on Who\u2019s Winning Climate Change? Today, we\u2019ll dive into the mailbag for the first Climate Question from an Adult \u2013 a series that will explore the business, culture and chemistry behind your most pressing questions about global warming. Have a question? Send it to us!\n\nQ: One of the few things that has given me hope about our ability to avoid climate disaster is reading about companies that are capturing carbon from the air and finding ways to monetize it. Are there limitations to our ability to do this? Is there a reason why this couldn\u2019t become a rapidly expanding industry in the next decade or so? \u2014 Andrew Janet, Maryland\n\nThere are worse reasons to invest in a nascent industry than that a Nobel prize-winning body heavily implied it would be a good idea. Since at least 2005, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been drawing attention to the benefits of \u201ccarbon capture and storage,\u201d the technologies that allow us to suck carbon dioxide from the air and trap it where it can\u2019t do any harm. Just last year, a special IPCC report on keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius found that some kind of carbon capture technology would be essentially required to maintain any hope of hitting that goal.\n\nThat should be good news for CCS as a commercial industry. But despite that, and despite the way several other climate and energy-related industries have grown over the last decade, carbon capture and storage is still more of a gamble than a clear success story.\n\nThe problem lies in a behavioral economics problem that differentiates this industry from solar power, electric cars and other profitable tech sectors, said Gregory Nemet, professor of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Namely: There\u2019s not really any reason to pay for CCS other than combating climate change. Turns out that saving the world, on its own, isn\u2019t necessarily a good enough reason to save the world.\n\nCarbon capture and storage works, essentially, because chemistry is nifty. There are many different ways to pull carbon dioxide out of the air or a column of factory smoke, but all methods are based on the principle that CO2 sticks to certain chemicals. So, for example, a coal-fired power plant in Saskatchewan, Canada, uses a system that you can kind of imagine as a giant bong. The plant takes the mixture of water vapor and gas left over after coal is burned and bubbles it up through a liquid that contains several chemicals related to ammonia. The CO2 clings to the liquid solution and the rest of the gases keep on rising up and out of the power plant smokestack. Heating the solution frees the CO2 molecules, which are then trapped and compressed in tanks. The liquid can be reused.\n\nThis process takes a lot of equipment. It takes energy to heat the liquid and compress the CO2, and that means the power plant has to burn more coal and produce more power than it did before. But while those facts mean carbon capture isn\u2019t cheap, it\u2019s also a pretty well-understood technology. The scrubbing process used at that Canadian power plant is cutting edge, in terms of reducing CO2 emissions, but it\u2019s old tech. The fossil fuel industry has been using the same process since the 1930s to improve the quality of natural gas. The main difference between the older process and the modern application is that the captured CO2 t is meant to be squirreled away indefinitely, where it can\u2019t ever reach the atmosphere.\n\nToday, there are 19 large-scale commercial carbon capture and sequestration facilities operating around the world, 10 of which are in the United States, according to the Global CCS Institute. All of them are pulling carbon dioxide out of the emissions from an associated factory or power plant. Systems that pull CO2 out of the ambient air, like the ones Andrew referenced in his question, do exist. They\u2019re just harder and more expensive to operate because the concentration of CO2 in the air is so much lower, Nemet said. \u201cAt a power plant, 10 to 20 percent of what goes up the smokestack is CO2, compared to .04 percent in the air,\u201d he said.\n\nSo generally speaking, the technology of carbon capture is ready to go. The problem with CCS is that it doesn\u2019t really have a destination, said Dan Lashof, U.S. director of the nonprofit World Resources Institute.\n\nOther climate-adjacent industries, such as electric vehicles and solar photovoltaics, have grown rapidly in the past decade. But Lashof pointed out the other industries offer benefits outside of their climate impact. \u201cSolar is generating electricity you can sell. Electric cars are really fun and fast and you don\u2019t have to go to the gas station. There\u2019s a market for that independent of climate benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a world where trapped carbon emissions are essentially worthless, there\u2019s not much reason for companies to invest in a technology that does nothing but reduce carbon emissions, experts told me. Wind, solar and electric cars were all able to start small and build on niche demand. But CCS hasn\u2019t really been able to do either of those things, said Howard Herzog, senior research engineer at the MIT Energy Initiative.\n\nThis in part explains why CCS boosters have so much enthusiasm for the idea of finding ways to monetize captured CO2. It\u2019s not just about winning at business. Barring the miraculous passage of a carbon tax, it might also be about the only way to get crucial climate tech off the ground.\n\nThere have been some successes. In Switzerland, for example, a company called Climeworks is sucking CO2 directly out of the air and selling it to soda companies and agricultural interests. \u201cThey pump it into greenhouses to increase the yield on tomatoes,\u201d Nemet said. But even those applications have to compete with naturally occurring CO2 extracted from the ground. In other cases, companies can just buy CO2 as a cheap byproduct from chemical manufacturing, he told me.\n\nAwkwardly, the most successful market for captured CO2 has been \u2026 extracting more fossil fuels, experts told me. Oil and gas companies buy CO2 extracted from the emissions of coal-fired power plants and pump it into depleted wells to help loosen more trapped hydrocarbons. It makes sense as a way to store CO2 \u2014 if you know the geology could reliably hold the oil and gas, then you know it can hold the CO2 as well. But the practice \u201ccomes with some baggage,\u201d as Nemet put it. Enabling the further burning of fossil fuels probably isn\u2019t what people like Andrew had in mind when they look at CCS as a reason for hope.\n\nThere are some policies that will likely help CCS solve its market problems. In 2018, Congress passed a tax credit that rewards companies for each metric ton of carbon dioxide they lock away. That, combined with new California laws that also reward companies for carbon sequestration, might make CCS truly profitable for the first time, said Geoff Holmes, head of business development at Carbon Engineering, a Canadian carbon management company.\n\nAgain, he\u2019s talking about CO2 used to pump more oil and gas out of the ground. But if these policies help a few additional CCS projects succeed, Holmes and Lashof think that could convince politicians to pass more laws that make sequestering CO2 valuable. And hopefully all of that would happen fast enough to get the direct-air capture industry off the ground in time to save the world. It\u2019s kind of a high-stakes game of chicken-or-egg, played in the middle of the interstate.\n\nThis has all gone in a bit of a \u201clet\u2019s undermine Andrew Janet\u2019s faith in humanity\u201d direction, and I apologize for that. But there is some reason to maintain hope, even if CCS never makes it to the other side of the road.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to accept that we won\u2019t keep global warming under 1.5 degrees, it might not matter much whether CCS becomes a winner or not, Nemet said. That\u2019s because so many other emissions-reducing technologies are winning. If you lump them all together, he said, the combination of solar, wind, electric vehicles, advanced batteries, liquid biofuels and other technologies could make enough of a dent that it doesn\u2019t matter whether CCS ever becomes cheap. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good thing we have these other possibilities that are emerging,\u201d he said. \u201cPotentially it eats away at the case for the necessity of CCS.\u201d", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-hiring-3-spring-interns/", "published": "2019-10-14T16:02:12", "title": "We\u2019re Hiring 2 Spring Interns", "text": "Want to work in a newsroom that combines reporting, writing, data analysis, computer science and a general sense of irreverence?

Maybe you call it a silo. Maybe you just call it an echo chamber. But whatever metaphorical, narrow and enclosed space you prefer, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve been told that one of the great social problems of our time is Americans getting their political news from biased sources. Conservatives watch Fox News. Liberals watch MSNBC. The news tells us what we already believe and distorts reality around partisan talking points.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: That\u2019s not how it works. Turns out, news of our bloated, biased media diets has been greatly exaggerated. It could even be said that the \u201cmedia bubble\u201d narrative is \u2026 wait for it \u2026 fake news.\n\nLast week, I wrote an article about how partisanship affects the way we interpret facts. Two people might see the same facts about the current impeachment investigation but interpret that news in wildly different ways. After that story ran, I got a lot of letters from folks who wanted to know how much of that effect was due to media bubbles. Sure, we interpret facts differently. But are we even getting the same facts?\n\nWell, yeah, actually. Mostly, we are. That\u2019s according to Brendan Nyhan, government professor at Dartmouth. \u201cPeople have a notion from hearing about [information echo chambers] that most Americans are getting news and information from a very slanted media diet,\u201d he told me. \u201cEmpirical evidence suggests that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nYes, seriously. Consider, for instance, the simple math of TV ratings. There are about 122 million Americans who told the Census Bureau that they voted in 2018. The vast majority of those voters don\u2019t watch partisan cable news. FOX News and MSNBC pull in around 3 million viewers when their top hosts are on air. In contrast, around 5 million people tune in to each of the network nightly news shows. More Americans have a centrist media diet than a slanted one. And most Americans are basically fasting.\n\nEven social media, which has provided new opportunities for echo chambers to form, doesn\u2019t seem to be all that successful at politically isolating most of us. In 2018, Nyhan and his colleagues published a paper that found that, while Facebook really was a hive of fake news scum and villainy, the audience for those biased and often fabricated stories was relatively small. In a national sample of about 2,500 Americans, taken during the final weeks of the contentious 2016 presidential campaign, nearly 60 percent of all fake news visits came from the 10 percent of respondents with the most conservative media diets. Our national crisis is actually a niche issue.\n\nSure, we all do like to hear perspectives that verify what we already think we know. Who doesn\u2019t enjoy being told that we are smarter than people we don\u2019t like? But while lab experiments suggest that could cause us to silo ourselves, reality looks a little more nuanced. In a 2016 paper, researchers tracked a sample of 50,000 Americans who heavily consumed online news and found that their reading was overwhelmingly self-directed (rather than algorithm-selected) and mainstream centrist in orientation. And, while the use of social networks and search engines were associated with a larger partisan divide \u2014 they were also associated with people being more frequently exposed to more opinions they disagreed with.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that the media polarization that exists has no effect at all on our national politics. It might not be shaping the individual opinions of the vast majority of Americans, but the small percentage of highly polarized people are also the loudest, politically speaking, Nyhan said. \u201cThey consume a disproportionate amount of the news and the parties are most responsive to them because they\u2019re the most politically engaged,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that can present some problems of its own. Take, for instance, the influence that a vocal minority can have on the people closest to them. There\u2019s some evidence that in-person conversations are actually more powerful polarizers than any TV station or website. In one study from 2018, the polarizing effects of talking to people who share your partisan political bent were more than twice as large as the effects of consuming politically biased media. Our coffee dates may be more effective conveyors of fake news than our Facebooks.\n\nCORRECTION (Oct. 8, 2019, 5:15 p.m.): A previous version of this article misstated where Brendan Nyhan works.

Back in 2012, researchers from Kent State University presented survey respondents a hypothetical news story: A partisan political group has been caught swiping yard signs and defacing campaign ads. Then they asked the respondents to rate both the seriousness of crime (which, technically, it is) and how justifiable it was to break the rules. The overwhelming response: It\u2019s not that big of a deal and it is reasonably justifiable \u2014 at least, as long as the party affiliation of the group doing the vandalism matched the affiliation of the person answering the question. If the other guys are doing it, well, by jove, Geoffrey, that is just not how things are done. Drawing squiggly moustaches upon an opponent\u2019s face is fine for me \u2026 but not for thee.\n\nNow a stolen yard sign is not exactly an impeachable offense. But there is a lesson here about the more serious scandal currently threatening to swamp President Trump.\n\nIt is not your imagination \u2014 partisanship really does affect the way we understand evidence of a scandal and how we interpret that evidence. You can see that in the polls that came out this week, which show sharp divides between Democrats who overwhelmingly support impeachment proceedings and Republicans who overwhelmingly oppose them. You can also see it in the comments of politicians \u2014 while Democrats see obvious malfeasance in Trump\u2019s pressuring the Ukrainian president to look into the Bidens, Republicans have called the conversation a \u201cnothingburger\u201d that Democrats are hyping as an excuse to reach a foregone conclusion. And while partisanship isn\u2019t the only thing that creates those dueling realities, experts say it\u2019s the biggest factor. And it probably matters more now than it did in the past.\n\nThere are many different personal factors that affect how people evaluate the evidence for or against a political scandal and what they think should be done about it. Gender \u2014 both the politician\u2019s and the voters\u2019 \u2014 is one example, said Nick Vivyan, a politics professor at the U.K.\u2019s Durham University. He\u2019s found evidence that female voters have more of an interest in punishing female politicians\u2019 who misbehave, compared to how those same voters treat men. Male voters are also more likely to treat male politicians more leniently than they treat female ones. (This is just one of many structural reinforcements that makes the glass ceiling of politics so hard for American women to crack through.)\n\nExternal social and political context also affect whether a scandal sticks and what impact it has. When Brendan Nyhan, professor of government at Dartmouth, studied Washington Post coverage of presidential scandals between 1977 and 2008, he found that controversies became news faster and were covered more extensively when presidents had lower approval ratings among opposition voters and when there was simply less happening in the news to distract the reporters.\n\nBut while those things matter, Vivyan told me, it\u2019s partisanship that is \u201cthe most obvious and often the most salient\u201d factor at play. \u201cPartisanship is the biggest predictor we have,\u201d he said, of whether someone who looks at a set of facts will see an im\ud83c\udf51ment waiting to happen or just so much rotten fruit.\n\nAnd that effect has grown over time in the United States, as partisans of both parties dislike one another more and have stronger negative emotional reactions to the other side, said Eva Anduiza, professor of political science at Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona. This \u201caffective polarization\u201d is something that\u2019s been measured by the American National Election Study\u2019s \u201cfeelings thermometer\u201d since the late 1970s. The survey asks respondents to rate their feelings about \u201cDemocrats\u201d and \u201cRepublicans\u201d on a 100-point scale and then compares how people rate the party they identify with vs. the one they don\u2019t.\n\nSince 1980, our average feelings about \u201cthe other guys\u201d have become significantly chilly \u2014 falling from around 50 to around 25 points on the 100-point scale. In fact, almost all the significant increase in affective polarization is due to an increased dislike of the other side and not, say, an increased preference for your own side.\n\nThat kind of emotional partisanship matters for scandals because it increases the likelihood of motivated reasoning \u2014 basically upping our tendency to not want to hear things that contradict our previously held beliefs. In the case of politics, that means finding reasons why the other side\u2019s scandals are a very big deal and/or finding reasons why our own preferred party\u2019s scandals are not.\n\n\u201cPeople who are strong partisans will tend to have the blinkers on,\u201d said Elisabeth Gidengil, professor of political science at McGill University in Canada. \u201cThey\u2019ll try to discount what\u2019s happening and say it\u2019s not that serious. All the parties do this.\u201d And she does mean all. Gidengil has found evidence of this effect in Canadian politics. Anduiza has seen it in Spain. Vivyan in the U.K. If it\u2019s happening in multiple countries to many different political parties, you might be forced to accept that it\u2019s also something you and your fellow partisans might be doing right here in the good old US of A.\n\nThere\u2019s evidence political partisanship can make you more biased against others than racism does, at least in some circumstances. Nyhan even thinks this partisan affective polarization could be behind conflicting research that sometimes suggests the people who know the most about a controversial issue like climate change or a presidential scandal are more likely to dig in their heels and refuse to change their minds even in the face of new evidence. It\u2019s not that knowing more details of a case makes you less willing to change your mind, he said. It\u2019s more that the people who are the most affectively polarized to begin with also have the most reason to pay attention to the news. Maybe they know the details not because they\u2019re doing thoughtful, unbiased observation, but because they\u2019re keeping close track of the political ballgame and how their team scored points.\n\nOf course, if what you want to hear is that Democrats and Republicans could really join hands and sing together in the spirit of harmony and peace, then all of this is rather disheartening. After all, there are good reasons why some scandals should stick (and others should not), and partisan divides get in the way of finding that middle ground.\n\nBut there is some good news. Researchers are finding that there are ways around strong partisan affective polarization \u2014 and they don\u2019t even depend upon the two sides coming to an agreement on actual policy. In a 2019 study involving nearly 1,000 political partisans, \u201cwarm contact\u201d between political leaders did more to reduce affective polarization and negative opinions about the other party than issue compromise.

One of the first great medicines of the antibiotic era, sulfanilamide was a miracle drug at a time when curing pneumonia with a quick trip to the pharmacy seemed akin to walking on water. When a sweet, raspberry-flavored liquid version appeared in stores in early September of 1937, it was a no-brainer prescription for doctors whose sick young patients were still picky enough they might reject even Jesus himself if he returned in the form of a bitter-tasting pill.\n\nBy the end of October, more than 100 of those patients had died and regulators were scrambling to figure out why.\n\nAll of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again. Today, medical experts and federal regulators are struggling to understand a mysterious lung disease linked to the use of electronic cigarettes. As of Sept. 17, 530 people have been diagnosed across the country, seven of whom have died. Neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor the Food and Drug Administration can definitively say what is causing the illness or why a device that was supposed to help people stop smoking cancer-causing cigarettes has, itself, turned deadly.\n\nRegardless of why e-cigs have turned toxic, historians and consumer law advocates see lessons in the sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 \u2014 ones that go beyond the obvious surface similarities of poisonous, fruit-flavored liquids. Both cases highlight the way consumer protections in this country are reactive, cropping up in response to disease and death, rather than preventing it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s insanely heartbreaking letters from these doctors who had prescribed [sulfanilamide elixir] and then watched kids die,\u201d said Deborah Blum, author of \u201cThe Poison Squad,\u201d a book about the founding of the FDA. Those deaths were painful and prolonged, stretching out over days and weeks of convulsions, nausea, kidney failure and stupor. \u201cNo one had any idea what was going on. The FDA was desperately sending scientists around the country,\u201d she told me.\n\nEventually, a Kansas City FDA inspector confirmed that eight children and one adult who died in his area had all taken the same medication, prepared by S.E. Massengill Co., based in Tennessee. Chemists broke the concoction down, molecule by molecule, and discovered that Massengill had blended its antibiotic with diethylene glycol. In other words, it had taken medicine and raspberry flavoring and mixed it up with antifreeze.\n\nA similarly desperate cross-country investigation is happening now with the vaping-related lung deaths, but pinning down a cause is proving harder in this case. There\u2019s no tell-tale chemical turning up in every sample. Eighty-four percent of the 53 patients whose cases were reported in a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine did admit to using e-cigarette pods that contained THC, the chemical in pot that gets you high. But that\u2019s a small and geographically isolated sampling. Other than vaping, itself, there\u2019s no single behavior all the victims share. There\u2019s no Massengill in our modern story, no single company glowing ominously like a lit cigarette in a dark alley.\n\nMore frustratingly, said Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, there are several reasons why patients might not be giving doctors an accurate account of what they\u2019ve used and how. Some are too sick. Some might not want to talk to the government about their THC use. The state of Illinois has begun an anonymous survey of healthy e-cigarette users, hoping to spot some differences between the people who have gotten sick and those who haven\u2019t. It\u2019s likely there\u2019s more than one poison at play.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s also not a clear trail of what was sold, who sold it and whom they sold it to. That was true in the 1937 disaster, as well. But investigators knew Massengill had made the product and tried to recall it. E-cigarettes, in contrast, are more of a mom and pop affair. Lots of people are making and selling e-liquids and some of them are amateurs, working off the books. That\u2019s especially true of liquids containing THC.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t just about a contaminated black market. Even the e-liquids with the most professional pedigrees haven\u2019t been subject to stringent safety regulations, said Desmond Jensen, an attorney with the Public Health Law Center at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law. In 1937, Blum said, pro-regulation advocates had already been warning people for years that there were too many loopholes in FDA rules. And the same is true in this case. There were no FDA regulations at all on e-cigarettes until 2016, and the regulations that exist now are more like swiss cheese than solid cheddar, Jensen said.\n\n\u201cWhen you say a product is regulated, the average person thinks about pesticides, food or drugs,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s someone making sure it\u2019s not tainted, or making sure it won\u2019t make us sick. That\u2019s not what it means here.\u201d Instead, the FDA requires sellers and manufacturers of e-cigarettes and e-liquids to register with and disclose ingredients to the agency. But that isn\u2019t the same as quality or safety testing, Jensen said. And a lot of companies haven\u2019t registered in the two years those regulations have been in effect. Safety testing regulations do exist \u2014 but their implementation keeps getting scooched back under pressure from vaping companies. Currently, products that were on the market before 2016 won\u2019t have to be reviewed for safety until May of 2020. Manufacturers who don\u2019t sell directly to consumers haven\u2019t had to register or disclose ingredients at all.\n\nIn 1937, it was completely legal to sell antifreeze-sweetened medicine to children. The only crime the Massengill company could be charged with was misbranding its liquid as an \u201celixir,, which legally had to contain alcohol, rather than as a \u201csolution,\u201d Blum said. (In fact, this distinction was the only thing that allowed the FDA to get involved and recover the tainted medicine from consumers to begin with.) The sulfanilamide disaster changed everything about consumer safety. Within a year, we had a new Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that, for the first time, gave the FDA the power to demand companies prove a drug was safe before it could be sold.\n\nAnd that\u2019s effectively the problem we have with e-cigarettes today, Jensen said. The pre-sale approval process exists, but there are thousands of products it doesn\u2019t yet apply to. Meanwhile, it\u2019s legal to sell e-cigarette liquids that contain chemicals we\u2019ve banned as food additives, or that contain chemicals nobody has even thought to list in a database because they form in the package after the ingredients have been mixed together. And while states have begun to ban flavored e-liquids in response to the lung disease outbreak (and the federal government may do the same), that doesn\u2019t solve consumer protection problems that aren\u2019t related to flavoring, such as liquid nicotine that contains far more of the drug than is claimed on the label, or e-cigarette devices manufactured in China that aren\u2019t being held to any kind of safety standards.\n\nBut it\u2019s no real surprise we\u2019ve ended up here, said Marian Moser Jones, a public health professor at the University of Maryland. Our laws aimed at stopping products from poisoning people have usually come in reaction to deaths and illness, rather than before.\n\nUltimately, Moser Jones said, you can look on both historical poisoning cases and the current vaping crisis as a direct result of consumer product safety policy that often favors a right to sell over a right to know that what is being sold is safe. \u201cIn other countries there\u2019s less of a question about whether the government has a right to interfere with commerce,\u201d she said. When the careful balance between retailers rights and consumers tips too far to one side, people die.\n\nCORRECTION (Oct. 1, 12:43 p.m.): An earlier version of this story misidentified Marian Moser Jones\u2019s department at the University of Maryland.

A lot of those questions sat squarely under umbrella topics we expected: how climate science works, what individuals can do to prevent greenhouse gas emissions and what crazy technological solutions might actually be effective. We\u2019ll be coming back to those later. But first, we wanted to address a different sort of question: Who is winning climate change? Sure, climate change is a very bad thing in a larger, existential sense. But are there animals and plants whose habitats will expand in a warmer world? Is there anybody who has figured out how to profit off the coming apocalypse? Won\u2019t some places be nicer to live in than others? You wanted to know. We\u2019re going to find out.\n\nMatthew Kahn has dreamed about buying a climate change retreat. If anybody would know where to go, you\u2019d think it would be an environmental economist who literally wrote the book on which cities will adapt to a warming world and how they\u2019ll do it. But rather than investing in land that\u2019s safe from the risks of coastal flooding, midwestern downpours and crippling drought \u2014 Kahn was thinking Bozeman, Mont. \u2014 he\u2019s instead settling into a new job in Baltimore, a city that\u2019s expected to be flooding daily by the end of the century.\n\nWhen we asked for your climate change questions, we ended up with 20 different responses that were all asking a version of the same thing: Where should I move if I want to avoid the worst of it?\n\nTurns out, finding a place in the U.S. that is benefiting from climate change is both easy and hard, researchers say. It\u2019s not difficult to find the places at the lowest risk of experiencing the biggest hazards. Popular Science has mapped it using data from a variety of scientific research papers and risk assessment reports. Economists have mapped it based on projected changes in various quality of life indexes. Nonprofits are working on projects that will map it based on flooding risks.\n\nBut it\u2019s one thing to look at these maps and start dreaming of your climate condo in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. It\u2019s another thing entirely to say that it is a place you should move now. Or that the Upper Peninsula is necessarily going to \u201cwin,\u201d just because in the long term it\u2019s less subject to the negative side effects of a changing climate. The problem is one of both personal preferences and economics. We don\u2019t all like the same weather. We seldom make investment choices on long time scales. We value things about our hometowns, other than whether they\u2019re safe from a wildfire. It\u2019s hard to predict which regions might win climate change when we don\u2019t all agree on what \u201cwin\u201d means.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of areas, in the short run, that actually improve,\u201d said David Albouy, professor of economics at the University of Illinois. In 2016, he published a paper that compared the places Americans currently prefer to live with the predicted environmental change under global warming. In doing so, he produced maps of how quality of life might change in various parts of the country. \u201cIt\u2019s still a generation away,\u201d he said. But according to his estimates, Northern Minnesota, Seattle, Portland, Ore., and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan could all end up with more moderate temperatures and weather patterns than they currently have.\n\nHis maps, which include upstate New York and much of New England among the regions improved by climate change, somewhat align with estimates of the safest places to live made by mapping disaster risk alone. That\u2019s especially true for the Upper Peninsula, a region fortunate enough to avoid increased risks of sea level rise, drought, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires and disease-carrying mosquitoes.\n\nBut despite the occasional trend story about coastal millennials moving to places that seem better positioned to ride out the ravages of climate change, there\u2019s no real evidence that the Upper Peninsula is attracting new residents due to its climate prospects. In fact, nearly every county in the region has lost population in the last decade. Somebody found the place you should move. But nobody is moving there. So what gives?\n\nThat\u2019s partly because real estate investing works at a different pace than climate change does, Albouy and Kahn told me. The maps that show the Upper Peninsula winning against other parts of the country are forecasts of the year 2100. \u201cBut why does it matter that [the value of the land] will go up in 100 years?\u201d Albouy said.\n\nEven coastal Florida, a region that\u2019s been repeatedly affected by rising sea levels and storm surge from hurricanes, hasn\u2019t yet seen a decrease in property values, said Matthew Eby, founder and director of First Street Foundation, a nonprofit that\u2019s attempting to improve and expand flood risk mapping in the United States. The value of those homes aren\u2019t rising as fast as homes further inland, he told me. His modeling suggests hundreds of millions of dollars in lost appreciation value. But the prices are still rising, and coastal property continues to be worth more than inland property. Just as climate scientists have long warned about the way climate change\u2019s slowly raising stakes make them easier for politicians to ignore, real estate investors are also subject to the frog-in-a-pot-of-boiling-water problem.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only reason there\u2019s not a run on real estate in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., however. Let\u2019s back up to the study that Albouy published. His approach was based on calculating the financial drawbacks Americans are willing to put up with in exchange for pleasant weather today. For instance, wages are basically average in Hawaii and the cost of living is exceptionally high. But lots of people live there anyway. \u201cWhy? Because the weather is perfect,\u201d he said.\n\nBut here\u2019s where spotting the climate winners gets tricky, Albouy told me. When people talk about the best place to move to avoid climate risks, he thinks they\u2019re usually thinking about places that are currently too cold becoming, well, more like California and other parts of the country in which Americans are willing to take economic losses in order to enjoy today.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how climate change works. Michigan is getting warmer and wetter, but it\u2019s still colder than Albouy\u2019s calculations \u2014 or 30 years of data on American internal migration \u2014 suggest Americans really want it to be. Meanwhile, climate change tends to exacerbate extremes and increase the risk of probabilistically rare disaster events \u2014 things that don\u2019t really make a place better even if they make it warmer. Imagine a Chicago with winters that aren\u2019t much different than they are today, but summers that are more like those of Memphis. \u201cClimate change doesn\u2019t deliver quite the climate change they\u2019d like to see,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if it did, Kahn said, there are all kinds of incentives \u2014 both social and economic \u2014 that make staying in a riskier region attractive. Consider the citizens of New Orleans, who have for generations known their city was prone to flooding and saw rising sea levels for years before Hurricane Katrina. Research since that disaster has shown that survivors who were displaced by the storm ended up making more money in their new cities. So why not move sooner? New Orleans had their families and their communities, and moving itself is expensive, Kahn said.\n\nIn the end, leaving a risky city before you have to might not look like a great option, even if you stand to economically benefit in the long run. If your climate \u201cwin\u201d is at odds with where your family and friends are, it might not actually be a win.\n\nCORRECTION (Sept. 20, 2019, 11:00 a.m.): A previous version of this article used the word \u201cYooper\u201d to refer to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Last week, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record made a direct hit on the northern Bahamas and stalled there, destroying nearly half the homes on Great Abaco and Grand Bahamas islands. Days later, with their homes in ruins and food and water scarce, hundreds of fleeing Bahamians were asked to leave a ferry bound for Fort Lauderdale, Fla., because they didn\u2019t have a U.S. visa \u2014 despite visas not being required in the past. And while U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials blamed the ferry operator, the federal government announced Wednesday it wouldn\u2019t be extending the Dorian survivors temporary protected status.\n\nRising sea levels, wildfires, drought or a slow-moving hurricane can all threaten your way of life as surely as a bomb. But unlike victims of war for whom the causes and effects of the threats are clear and codified, there are no protections for environmental migrants. That\u2019s despite World Bank estimates that tens of millions of people could be climate refugees by 2050, research showing asylum seeking already increases in response to climate-related issues like rising temperatures, and the fact that researchers have been talking about the plight of people who must escape not-entirely-natural disasters since at least 1988. Technically, in the context of legal and political systems, climate refugees don\u2019t exist. There\u2019s no space for them in international law and no special plans for how to treat them in the United States when they arrive. Here and around the world, fleeing climate change means running to bureaucracies as inhospitable to your survival as the places you left behind.\n\nJust ask Ioane Teitiota, a man from the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati who applied for asylum in New Zealand in 2010 on the basis that rising sea levels were slowly swallowing the land under his feet. His claim was denied because he didn\u2019t fit existing definitions of what a refugee can be. Same with the other Pacific Islanders who have been seeking status as environmental migrants in Australia and New Zealand since at least 2000. The problem for Teitiota and others wasn\u2019t that immigration officials didn\u2019t believe climate change was happening. If only it were that simple and easy to judge. Instead, the rulings centered on the fact that systems designed in the 1950s simply aren\u2019t accommodating the needs of the modern world.\n\nLife-threatening climate change crises are almost never just one thing. In Teitiota\u2019s case, New Zealand\u2019s Immigration and Protection Tribunal pointed out (correctly) that climate change was stacked on top of other problems on Kiribati \u2014 too much population growth, not enough sanitation infrastructure and greater numbers of people packing into urban areas. Sure, Teitota\u2019s house was increasingly threatened by high tides, but other parts of the island were still safe. And, anyway, the Tribunal argued, refugee status in New Zealand is dependent on both the prospect of long-term human rights violations and a failure of the migrant\u2019s own state to act. If climate change exacerbates a downward spiral in Kiribatians\u2019 standard of living while developed nations that produce far more of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases do nothing \u2014 well, there\u2019s no legal precedent to call that a problem big enough for them to run from.\n\nClimate change is real. But it\u2019s also messy and complicated. In a climate change era, a hurricane can behave in a way that matches scientists\u2019 predictions of how extreme weather is likely to evolve on a hotter planet. But we can\u2019t say with absolute certainty that it was climate change \u2014 and climate change alone \u2014 that destroyed those Bahamian homes. In a climate change era, government policy (or lack thereof) can be directly responsible for death, destruction and impoverishment. But those don\u2019t count as human rights violations when nature is the weapon.\n\nAnd just as the complexity of climate systems can be used to sow doubt about the ways humans can alter them, complexity also can provide a convenient excuse for ignoring the victims of those changes. We can\u2019t be sure who counts as an environmental migrant and who doesn\u2019t. The paperwork isn\u2019t right. They just don\u2019t fit the established pathways.\n\nTo be fair, including environmental migrants would represent a radical shift in the way we think about migration. The original United Nations compact on refugees \u2014 the first international agreement to help displaced people \u2014 was signed in 1951 and basically only protected Europeans who had been made homeless or stateless by the second World War. Later agreements stripped away the limitations of geography and time, but not enough to encompass the effects of a slow-motion global disaster. Expanding migrant and refugee protections that far could potentially allow millions of new asylum claims. Low-immigration advocacy groups consider it incompatible with U.S. sovereignty.\n\nSo climate change migrants are stuck in a legal and political gray zone. Our systems aren\u2019t designed for them. Changing those systems would be complicated, inconvenient and expensive. Efforts to create frameworks to take them into account run into opposition \u2014 such as the U.N. compact on migration that was signed last December, which was rejected by the U.S. and other countries most responsible for the changing climate. If this all sounds a bit like what got us into this climate problem to begin with, well, yes, it is.\n\nThere\u2019s not necessarily a clear answer to what we should do about climate migrants. Again, it\u2019s complicated. But what is clear is that ignoring the problem doesn\u2019t make it go away. If rising temperatures and volatile weather have taught us anything, it\u2019s that threats don\u2019t vanish just because you refuse to make eye contact. When the U.S. denies Bahamian survivors of Hurricane Dorian protected status, we\u2019re participating in another international failure to protect the people most harmed by climate change. It is, in some ways, a microcosm of climate change itself.

In a survey released earlier this week by the National Association of Business Economics, 38 percent of economists predicted that the country will slip into an economic downturn next year, and another recent poll of economists put the chances of a recession in the next 12 months at 1 in 3. Those predictions are getting a lot of attention, and it\u2019s not hard to see why \u2014 an economic slowdown in the middle of the presidential election cycle could reshape the race, potentially changing the calculus of Democratic primary voters and undermining President Trump, who has made the strong economy a central selling point of his presidency.\n\nBut take a deep breath before you spend a lot of time trying to figure out how a recession would change Trump\u2019s reelection chances: Although the economy does have a big effect on an incumbent president\u2019s odds of winning a second term, economists have a terrible track record when it comes to predicting recessions.\n\n\u201cVery, very few recessions have been predicted nine months or a year in advance,\u201d Prakash Loungani, an economist at the International Monetary Fund, told me.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean a recession won\u2019t strike in the near future. Over the past few weeks and months, there have been some worrisome signals about the country\u2019s economic health, fueling broader concerns about an impending recession. But exactly when the next economic downturn will come \u2014 and specifically whether it will interrupt the 2020 election cycle \u2014 is extremely uncertain. \u201cThere\u2019s no economic data or research or analysis that suggests we can look 12 months into the future and predict recessions with any confidence,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, a professor of economics at George Washington University.\n\nInstead, and despite the recent rash of stories about economists\u2019 predictions, economic downturns usually come as a surprise. A 2018 study conducted by Loungani and others looked at 153 recessions in 63 countries between 1992 and 2014 and found that the vast majority were missed by economists in both the public and private sector. This was painfully true in the case of the global financial crisis in 2008, which wasn\u2019t officially declared a recession until it had been going for almost a year. Other studies have found that in general, forecasters are too sunny about economic growth.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Loungani, was that in the past, economists were unwilling to risk their reputations by predicting an imminent recession that never came to pass. So it might actually be a good thing, he said, if more economists were now willing to sound the alarm. But Sinclair noted that even now, relatively few are pointing to an immediate crisis. In one of the polls, for instance, the share of economists who said they were expecting a recession this year fell from 10 percent in February to 2 percent in July.\n\nAnd even if economists are more willing to be wrong these days than they were a decade ago, the task of predicting recessions itself hasn\u2019t become easier. We have plenty of clues about how the economy is doing, but a system that\u2019s so big, complex and deeply intertwined with human psychology and actions will always be difficult to predict.\n\nRecently, for instance, the financial world flew into a tizzy over the inverted yield curve, which is generally seen as a reliable harbinger of an economic downturn. An inverted yield curve appears when short-term investments pay more than long-term ones, and it generally reflects a pessimistic mood among investors about the economy\u2019s future performance. When the yield curve stays inverted for three months \u2014 as it did earlier this year \u2014 that\u2019s a clear sign that a recession could be coming, according to research by Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University. But it\u2019s not a guarantee, since an inverted yield curve doesn\u2019t itself cause a recession. Instead, it\u2019s a reflection of how investors feel about the economy\u2019s future \u2014 and those feelings could be off-base. Other economists, like Sinclair, also said they\u2019re not sure yet what the inverted yield curve means \u2014 and Harvey added that although it has a good predictive track record, it\u2019s just one signal in a complex economic landscape.\n\nEven if the inverted yield curve proves prescient and a downturn does come, we don\u2019t have a good way to pinpoint when it will hit. According to Harvey, recessions have followed inverted yield curves by anywhere between six and 22 months. That\u2019s not a small range, especially in political terms \u2014 it\u2019s the difference between an economic slowdown that begins just before the Iowa caucuses and a recession that starts five months after the next presidential inauguration.\n\nAnd in the meantime, consumers, investors and policymakers will all keep doing things that affect the economy. It\u2019s possible that the anxious headlines about an impending recession could become self-fulfilling if everyday people respond by saving their money instead of spending it. Or maybe the opposite will happen, and smart policy responses to early warning signals could ward off a recession or make it less damaging.\n\nEither way, the unpredictability of human behavior will frustrate anyone trying to pin down exactly when a recession will arrive. That doesn\u2019t mean economists should stop making forecasts or that signals like the inverted yield curve aren\u2019t useful. But anyone looking at predictions about when the next recession will land should take those forecasts with a big grain of salt. \u201cGiven historical patterns, a recession is likely to come again, so we need to be talking about what we\u2019re going to do when it hits,\u201d Sinclair said. \u201cBut we have to be open about the fact that we don\u2019t really know when that will be.\u201d", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-hiring-a-visual-journalist-to-cover-sports-the-2020-election-and-more/", "published": "2019-06-25T18:32:01", "title": "We\u2019re Hiring A Visual Journalist To Cover Sports, The 2020 Election And More", "text": "We\u2019re Hiring A Visual Journalist To Cover Sports, The 2020 Election And More\n\nFiveThirtyEight\u2019s graphics and interactives team is growing!

Hansen is accused of receiving at least $800,000 from Chinese sources in exchange for information he learned from \u201cmilitary and intelligence conferences in the U.S.\u201d and for sensitive technology that the U.S. government had banned from being shared with China.\n\nHansen is the fourth former intelligence officer \u2014 along with Jerry Chun Shing Lee, Joshua Schulte and Kevin Mallory \u2014 arrested for espionage or attempted espionage in just the last year. But one part of his story sets him apart: Hansen\u2019s payoff \u2014 at least $800,000 \u2014 is more than the vast majority of people arrested for spying over the past few decades were paid.\n\nOf course, we\u2019re talking about spying here, so there\u2019s only so much we know about these cases \u2014 even the spies who get caught are pretty good at keeping secrets, and the people who catch them are even better. But we can get at least a rough overview of how much spies get paid using two sources: the Defense Personnel Security Research Center\u2019s research into espionage from 1975 to 2008, and its report from last year updating the data to 2015. For cases since 2015, we can use Justice Department press releases.\n\nThe data is incomplete, of course \u2014 it can\u2019t tell us anything about any spies who weren\u2019t caught or whose payout information was never made public \u2014 but all told, I identified more than 100 people who were arrested for spying or similar offenses since 1975 and for whom we can estimate how much they were paid. I then adjusted those income estimates to 2018 dollars, using the year the person was arrested to approximate the year that the payoff was made. It\u2019s an imperfect method, especially for someone like former FBI Special Agent Robert Hanssen, who was arrested in 2001 but likely earned most of his money between 1985 and 1991. But people committing espionage tend not to keep meticulous details of their illicit income, so payment details are, for the most part, best guesses made from the publicly available data.\n\nIn any case (caveats aside), what does the data show? There was very little financial gain for the vast majority of people arrested for spying in the cases for which we have payoff data. Most people in our data set didn\u2019t sell secrets so much as give them away: 56 percent got no known compensation for their actions. Another 9 percent were paid less than $12,000, not even enough for the average used car.\n\nSome people \u2014 such as Cuban spy Ana Montes \u2014 spied for ideological reasons and may have refused payment out of principle. Most of those who weren\u2019t paid, though, were intercepted before they could do real damage \u2014 such as Brian Regan, an officer from the National Reconnaissance Office who intended to sell secrets to China, Iraq and Libya for $13 million but was arrested before he could carry out his plan.\n\nOnly four U.S. spies are thought to have been paid at least $1 million over their careers: CIA officers Aldrich Ames and Larry Wu-Tai Chin, Army officer Clyde Conrad and Navy officer John Walker. So Hansen\u2019s alleged haul of $800,000 would place him near the top of the list in terms of income derived from passing secrets.\n\nUnsurprisingly, most people arrested for espionage or similar crimes receive lengthy prison sentences regardless of whether they\u2019ve earned lots of money \u2014 which they usually haven\u2019t. Ames, Conrad, Hanssen and Walker all received life sentences, while Wu-Tai Chin died by suicide prior to sentencing. Regan and National Guardsman Ryan Anderson similarly received life sentences for unsuccessfully trying to pass secrets to Iraq and Libya (Regan) and al-Qaida (Anderson). In terms of its risk-reward calculation, espionage doesn\u2019t seem like a good bet:\n\nOf course, there are a few limitations to looking at spy data like this.\n\nFirst and foremost, we can only analyze the spies we know about. There are undoubtedly many former and active spies out there that we may not know about for decades \u2014 if at all. The National Security Agency, for example, lists the code names of several assets discovered through VENONA \u2014 a Cold War project that aimed to decrypt Soviet cables sent in the 1940s \u2014 as either unidentified or having been identified only decades after their spying ended. One such asset was a woman code named \u201cTina\u201d who the Soviets claimed in 1945 had made a \u201cvaluable contribution\u201d to their efforts to steal the atom bomb, and it wasn\u2019t until 1992 that British authorities learned she had been a secretary named Melita Norwood.\n\nAnother challenge is that it\u2019s impossible to calculate any payments received by the handful of intelligence professionals who defected from the U.S. over the years. Edward Lee Howard evaded FBI surveillance in 1985 and made it to the Soviet Union after being fired from the CIA. Air Force officer Jeffrey Carney defected to East Germany in 1985, and NSA officers William Martin and Bernon Mitchell fled to Moscow in 1960. There\u2019s no way of accurately gauging how much money or valuables those defectors may have received from their new host countries.\n\nFinally, people who committed espionage on behalf of the U.S. may have made as much or more than even the $2.5 million (over $4 million in 2018 dollars) that Ames was allegedly paid by Russia. One former KGB officer was allegedly paid at least $7 million for a file with Hanssen\u2019s fingerprints and a voice recording of him talking with the KGB, according to a book by David Wise.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the case of \u201cAsset X,\u201d who led the CIA to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, according to a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report released in 2014. The information that Asset X gave the U.S. government would have qualified him to claim much or all of the $25 million reward for Mohammed\u2019s capture, and indeed Asset X\u2019s case officer used the reward to motivate the asset to find Mohammed.\n\nBut Asset X is more the exception than the rule. Mallory, one of the four U.S. intelligence officers arrested in the last year, was found guilty in early June on charges including selling secrets to China for $25,000. During his trial, Mallory\u2019s attorney argued that, \u201cNo one sells national defense information for $25,000. That is pocket change.\u201d\n\nAs the evidence shows, however, many people have traded classified information for little more than pocket lint.\n\nNote: Jeff Asher is a former CIA analyst.", "author": ["Jeff Asher"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-if-tariffs-cost-trump-the-farm-vote/", "published": "2018-04-26T11:01:40", "title": "What If Tariffs Cost Trump The Farm Vote?", "text": "In 1977, Jimmy Carter made an improbable journey from Georgia peanut grower to Democratic president in part by playing on his humble roots and receiving support from America\u2019s farmers. Yet this bedrock voting constituency abandoned a fellow farmer to back Ronald Reagan four years later, after Carter punished Moscow for invading Afghanistan by cutting off grain sales to the Soviet Union. U.S. farmers were already struggling with collapsing crop prices, and the embargo may have been the final straw. Farmers threw their support behind Reagan, who had promised to lift the hated restrictions.\n\nThis might seem like ancient history, but it\u2019s still relevant to \u2014 and well-remembered in \u2014 today\u2019s Farm Belt, where farmers are once again torn between devotion to a president and anger at the tariff policies he\u2019s imposed that are set to wreak havoc on agricultural prices. Although farmers overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump in 2016, discontent over tariffs and trade policy could induce farmers to oppose his bid for re-election \u2014 and their strategic location might just enable them to thwart it.\n\nFirst, Trump did really well in the states that have more farmers:\n\nIn particular, there are three states that Trump won by narrow margins in which a mass farmer defection could prove pivotal: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In each of these states, the number of farmers far exceeds the president\u2019s margin of victory in 2016. If all three states saw significant ag defection, a Democratic challenger could pick up a total of 46 Electoral College votes \u2014 enough to tip the balance even if Trump performs up to his 2016 standards in every other state in the union.\n\nWhere farmers could make a difference Number of farm operators and Trump\u2019s vote margin, for states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election state Trump Vote Margin No. farm operators Difference Michigan +10.7k 80.3k -69.6k \u2013 Wisconsin +22.7 111.1 -88.3 \u2013 Pennsylvania +44.3 92.3 -48.0 \u2013 Alaska +46.9 1.2 +45.7 \u2013 Arizona +91.2 33.6 +57.6 \u2013 Montana +101.5 45.2 +56.3 \u2013 South Dakota +110.3 49.0 +61.3 \u2013 Florida +112.9 74.5 +38.4 \u2013 Wyoming +118.4 19.7 +98.8 \u2013 North Dakota +123.0 45.0 +78.0 \u2013 Iowa +147.3 131.5 +15.8 \u2013 North Carolina +173.3 73.8 +99.5 \u2013 Utah +204.6 28.8 +175.7 \u2013 Georgia +211.1 61.9 +149.3 \u2013 Nebraska +211.5 75.9 +135.6 \u2013 Mississippi +215.6 55.6 +160.0 \u2013 Idaho +219.3 40.6 +178.7 \u2013 Kansas +244.0 92.9 +151.1 \u2013 South Carolina +300.0 37.1 +263.0 \u2013 West Virginia +300.6 32.2 +268.4 \u2013 Arkansas +304.4 69.7 +234.7 \u2013 Louisiana +398.5 41.6 +356.9 \u2013 Ohio +446.8 115.7 +331.1 \u2013 Missouri +523.4 152.8 +370.6 \u2013 Indiana +524.2 89.8 +434.3 \u2013 Oklahoma +528.8 121.6 +407.2 \u2013 Kentucky +574.1 114.2 +459.9 \u2013 Alabama +588.7 64.1 +524.7 \u2013 Tennessee +652.2 101.6 +550.6 \u2013 Texas +807.2 375.9 +431.3 \u2013 Sources: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, U.S. Census Bureau, DAVE LEIP\u2019S ATLAS OF U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS\n\nOf course, 2020 is unlikely to be an exact replay of 2016. But these swing states in the Midwest are a good bet to be competitive again, making any erosion of Trump\u2019s support among farmers a big worry for the president.\n\nSo what\u2019s getting in between Trump and farmers?\n\nTrump raised farmers\u2019 alarm bells when he bandied about the idea of pulling out of NAFTA and cutting off free trade with Canada, one of the biggest importers of U.S. agricultural products. As farmers\u2019 groups bought pricey airtime to run ads that attempted to dissuade policymakers from exiting the North American trade deal, a more immediate threat to the farm economy appeared on the horizon this month: In reaction to protectionist manufacturing tariffs leveled by the U.S., China \u2014 another big destination for U.S. agricultural products \u2014 retaliated, placing 15 percent tariffs on numerous agricultural exports and a 25 percent markup on pork products.\n\nWhen Trump responded by announcing plans for $100 billion in additional tariffs, China threatened more of its own, including one on the U.S.\u2019s top agricultural export, soybeans.\n\nIn a recent Senate Finance Committee meeting on Trump\u2019s tariffs, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley said that farmers in his state \u201cstill remember President Carter\u2019s grain embargo.\u201d Grassley reached the Senate in those same 1980 elections. \u201cThat\u2019s 38 years ago, but that\u2019s still in the memory of farmers,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, the Iowa senator knows his audience. The average age of U.S. farmers has been increasing over the past several decades, rising from 51 in 1982 to 58 in 2012 \u2014 the most recent year for which data is available. The average age is now likely to be close to 60 years old, which means that the bulk of U.S. farmers were old enough to vote when they abandoned Carter as a group in 1980.\n\nData on how farmers voted at that time is elusive, but anecdotal evidence suggests that the share of farmers who backed Reagan was high. A member of Reagan\u2019s agricultural transition team put the number at \u201cat least two-thirds,\u201d and The Washington Post described the farm sector as \u201cone of the most solid blocs for Reagan.\u201d The New York Times concluded that \u201cmany farmers who had voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976 supported Mr. Reagan\u201d in 1980 \u201cbecause they felt Mr. Carter had broken a campaign pledge never to establish an embargo on agricultural products except in a case of extreme national emergency.\u201d\n\nFlash forward to 2016, when 67 percent of farmers voted for Trump. Farmers were no doubt drawn to his deregulatory message and motivated by their perception that any Obama-era economic recovery had left them behind. In all regions, farmers are overwhelmingly Republican voters, regardless of the size of the operation.\n\nBut after months of controversy over farm labor visas, falling commodity prices and withdrawal from free-trade agreements, a recent survey conducted by Agri-Pulse, one of America\u2019s leading agricultural news sources, adds weight to Grassley\u2019s warning. The survey \u2014 conducted from Feb. 26 through March 9, before the most recent tariff battles \u2014 indicates that farmers are losing patience with the president. Although 67 percent said they had voted for Trump, only 45 percent said they would support his re-election.\n\nThere are fewer farmers today than there were in 1980. The number has shrunk by about 15 percent \u2014 from the approximately 2.4 million farms dotting the U.S. countryside to about 2 million today. Farmers now represent around 1 percent of the U.S. population. But the geographic distribution of these farmers, as well as their voting habits, could turn them into a powerful anti-Trump force ready to pop up in 2020 and alter the balance of the elections.\n\nThese Midwestern states are typically extremely close in presidential elections. They certainly were in 2016. And Trump would be more vulnerable there in 2020 if farmers abandoned him. Farmers are good voters in general, and in 2016, an estimated 74 percent of them turned out to vote in competitive states in the presidential elections. In Michigan, Trump won by 10,704 votes, and there are approximately 80,000 farmers in the state. And somewhere around 67 percent of them (let\u2019s call it 40,000) voted for Trump if they were consistent with national projections. All it would take is for slightly a little more than one in four of those farmers to jump ship to turn the tables against Trump. The numbers are similar in Wisconsin. (Trump won Pennsylvania by a bit more.)\n\nWe can use the Agri-Pulse poll to look at this in a slightly different way. If only 45 percent of Michigan farmers vote for Trump, he would get 27,000 farm votes \u2014 a loss of 13,100. Without any other change, Trump just lost Michigan and has been reduced to a razor-thin margin of victory Wisconsin. If 45 percent of Wisconsin farmers voted for Trump, he\u2019d get about 37,000 farm votes, a loss that would reduce his lead to around 5,000.\n\nElections, of course, don\u2019t work this way \u2014 one group moving while all others vote the same way \u2014 but the math shows that there are enough farmers in these crucial states to make a difference should they fully sour on Trump.\n\nOne thing we can be sure of is that these Chinese tariffs will have a negative impact on the agricultural sector in all three states. The first round of tariffs included two of Michigan\u2019s top agricultural products \u2014 hogs and apples \u2014 and two of Wisconsin\u2019s \u2014 hogs and cranberries. Also, soy is the third-largest agricultural product for both states. They both also count corn among their top 10 products; while the first round of tariffs imposed a 15 percent duty on ethanol, a key application for the U.S. corn crop, the second round of threatened tariffs included corn as well. While corn is a major export product for U.S. farmers, the Chinese market represents a very small market share for edible corn.\n\nFarmers may not be the massive voting bloc they once were, but as Jimmy Carter learned nearly four decades ago, presidents ignore farmers\u2019 needs \u2014 and erode farmers\u2019 markets \u2014 at great peril.", "author": ["Rebecca Shimoni Stoil"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/has-trump-made-the-working-class-great-again-not-if-youre-black-or-female/", "published": "2018-04-12T11:01:41", "title": "Where Blue-Collar America Is Strongest", "text": "President Trump seems ready to declare victory in his effort to make America great again; last month, he said the slogan for his 2020 re-election campaign will be \u201cKeep America Great.\u201d But how much has really changed, particularly for the \u201ceveryday, working Americans\u201d whom Trump said were the \u201cbackbone and heartbeat of our country\u201d \u2014 and whose votes helped him secure the presidency?\n\nRecent decades have been cruel to working-class Americans, a group I\u2019m roughly defining as the 84 million prime working-age people in the U.S. who lack a college degree. But in the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency, there was some good news. Workers with high school educations finally saw a sizable wage increase after years of scant growth. The economy added more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs, something that was unimaginable a decade ago when cheap imports from China put around a million Americans out of work.\n\nZoom in and this story about the turnaround of blue-collar America gets a lot less clear. That\u2019s partly because it lumps together large swaths of the population \u2014 rural and urban residents, white and black people, men and women \u2014 in a way that obscures the sometimes-gaping fissures between these groups. And the hidden reality doesn\u2019t always match up with the way politicians talk about blue-collar Americans, particularly when it comes to the plight of rural America and embattled white men.\n\nThink the rural heartland is the struggling core of modern America? Actually, America\u2019s middle has been outperforming the coasts for decades. And while Trump\u2019s ascendance has shined a spotlight on the plight of white men left behind by a changing economy, they still enjoy vast advantages over blue-collar black and female workers.\n\nLarge parts of rural America are doing fine\n\nIf you gather all of rural America into one homogeneous blob, the story looks bleak indeed, with the population shrinking as job growth lags. But this rural vs. the rest approach muddies the picture more than it reveals \u2014 because the experiences of rural areas vary widely across the country.\n\nIn particular, counties in the Plains states and the resource-rich middle of the country have enjoyed some of the largest per capita income gains in the entire country. And that includes lots of thinly populated spaces that easily fit the definition of rural.\n\nConsider the 200 counties that had the strongest per capita income growth nationwide from 2000 to 2016. More than 60 percent of those counties \u2014 122 \u2014 are designated \u201ccompletely rural\u201d by the U.S. Census Bureau. And the vast majority of those \u2014 99 \u2014 lie in a vertical band of 10 states that stretch from North Dakota and Montana south to New Mexico and Texas. That\u2019s five times what you\u2019d expect from chance alone; rural counties in this region make up just 10 percent of all counties nationwide, but nearly half of the top 200 with the highest income growth.\n\nLook to rural areas elsewhere in the country, and it\u2019s a different story. The median change in per capita income for the rural counties in the band was 38 percent, compared with just 21 percent for all the rural counties outside of that area. Only two rural counties in the entire area that stretches from Mississippi across to Florida and up to Delaware even crack the list of the top 200. Nebraska alone has six in the top 10.\n\nLooking at average incomes in this way has limitations, though, because it tells us nothing about distribution. Gains could have gone into the pockets of a highly educated few while everyone else was left with crumbs.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t seem to have been the case, at least not in that high-performing band of states in the middle-west. If you look specifically at wage gains among low-wage workers \u2014 instead of per capita income as a whole \u2014 the states where people saw the biggest wage increases from 2000 to 2016 are North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. Montana, Oklahoma and Nebraska are also among the top 10.\n\nAnother way to see that blue-collar residents in these states are outpacing peers elsewhere is to look at employment rates. The Plains states \u2014 including North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska \u2014 stand out for having large shares of 25- to 54-year-olds without college degrees who are employed. As you can see from the map below, some of the weakest areas are in the southern parts of the country.\n\nWhite workers fare well when compared with black workers\n\nAdd race to the mix, and the story of working-class America fractures into pieces. Whether you focus on wages or employment, black workers seem to be struggling far more than white or Hispanic workers.\n\nIn 2017, black workers with just a high school degree saw their wages fall, even as paychecks grew for similarly educated Hispanic and non-Hispanic white workers. And while Hispanics at every education level still earn less than non-Hispanic whites, the gap between whites and blacks is substantially larger. Black high school grads earn 78 cents for every dollar that white high school grads take home; Hispanic high school grads get 87 cents.\n\nNationwide, 65 percent of 25- to 54-year-old black Americans without a college degree have jobs, well below the 73 percent rate for Hispanics and 74 percent rate for non-Hispanic white people. But the gaps aren\u2019t uniform across the country.\n\nAs you can see from the map below, some of the areas with the highest employment rates for working class blacks are in the South, a very different regional pattern than you see for white workers. In contrast, the Midwest remains a region of relative strength for whites even though it has become a kind of shorthand for working-class woes.\n\nWorking-class men far outearn women\n\nAcross blue-collar America, working-class men are a relatively privileged group, with prospects that are vastly better than those of women: At every education level \u2014 from those with less than a high school degree to those with some some college \u2014 men outearn women by at least 20 percent.\n\nThese advantages are even more pronounced among white men. A recent paper from economists at Harvard, Stanford and the Census Bureau found that white men with lower-income parents tend to have incomes around $31,000, while white women with similarly paid parents earned just $23,000. Black women (and men) can expect a similar salary, between $23,000 and $25,000.\n\nAnd yet, even if they do make more than female and black workers, white men still aren\u2019t able to outearn their parents \u2014 a bleak commentary on the American Dream. Simply finding a job can be a struggle. In 1980, about 88 percent of 25- to 54-year-old white men without college degrees had jobs; today, that number is 80 percent.\n\nSo Trump might want to pause before popping the champagne corks. Many in his base are still hurting, and some of those in other constituencies are doing even worse.", "author": ["Evan Horowitz"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-pay-gap-is-way-too-entrenched-to-be-solved-by-women-alone/", "published": "2018-04-10T15:36:30", "title": "The Pay Gap Is Way Too Entrenched To Be Solved By Women Alone", "text": "Happy Equal Pay Day! (Or, as I like to call it, Women\u2019s New Year.) Today is the day that marks roughly how far into 2018 women had to work to earn a salary equal to what men got the year before. We\u2019d throw a parade and street fair, but we were too busy working to organize one.\n\nThis pay gap has been shrinking for more than three decades, but as of 2017, women still earn just 82 percent of what their male counterparts take home, according to calculations by the Pew Research Center. Since 1980, women have dramatically reshaped the workforce by earning college degrees and taking on paid labor at higher rates, but the pay gap persists despite these changes in part because women and men are still frequently split up into different types of jobs and industries. And jobs that are frequently done by women consistently pay less.\n\nResearch conducted by Francine Blau, a professor of economics at Cornell, suggests that this division between which jobs and industries men and women tend to work in \u2014 called sex segregation \u2014 is now the single biggest factor explaining the pay gap between men and women.\n\nBlau and her co-author, Lawrence Kahn, have published a series of studies on gender differences in pay, updating their results every few years. The most recent version, from 2016, found that, in 1980, the impacts of sex segregation explained about 20 percent of the overall pay gap. But by 2010, even though the wage gap itself had shrunk substantially, the proportion attributable to sex segregation actually increased \u2014 to 51 percent. So, for example, female financial advisers make 41 percent less than men with the same title \u2014 that\u2019s pay inequality \u2014 but only 33 percent of all financial advisers are women to begin with, and that\u2019s sex segregation. The researchers\u2019 calculations suggest that most of the overall wage gap can be explained by that second factor.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, when women become more represented in a job, the pay for that job tends to go down. A 2009 study looking at the relationship between sex segregation and pay over time found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of women working in an occupation was associated with that job\u2019s hourly wages dropping by between 0.5 and 5 percent over 10 years. Of the 10 highest-paid professions in America, just four are done by workforces in which at least 40 percent of employees are female. Meanwhile of the 10 lowest-paid professions, all but two count women as at least 40 percent of their employees.\n\nWomen do the jobs that pay the least Percentage of female employees in the 10 highest- and lowest-paid occupations in America by median weekly pay for full-time workers, 2017 Occupation Weekly pay Pct. female Chief executives $2,296 28% Architectural and engineering managers 1,999 9 Pharmacists 1,923 58 Physicians and surgeons 1,918 40 Lawyers 1,901 37 Aerospace engineers 1,892 9 Computer and info. systems managers 1,843 29 Nurse practitioners 1,841 92 Veterinarians 1,840 63 Electrical and electronics engineers 1,803 12 \u22ee Cooks 466 39 Counter attend., cafeteria, food concession and caf\u00e9 460 62 Dining room and cafeteria attend., bartender helpers 458 46 Laundry and drycleaning workers 450 68 Maids, housekeeping, cleaners 450 88 Cashiers 438 73 Food prep. workers 425 59 Food prep. and serving workers, incl. fast food 407 60 Hosts, hostesses, restaurant, lounge, caf\u00e9 401 86 Dishwashers 401 20 Based on a ranking of occupations for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics provides data. Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Pew Research Center\n\nForty years ago, other factors explained a larger percentage of the pay gap. Women were significantly less like to have a college education than men, for example, and they participated in the workforce at far lower rates. Today, Blau said, more women than men earn college degrees. And as women\u2019s education levels and workforce participation rate increased, the overall pay gap decreased.\n\nBut these big-picture changes obscured how much more some women benefited than others. Race now plays a larger role in explaining the pay gap than it did 40 years ago, according to Blau\u2019s research, partly because white and Asian women were much more likely to be the ones getting all those college degrees. So while white and Asian women\u2019s wages have moved much closer to parity with white men\u2019s, black and Hispanic women haven\u2019t seen nearly as much of a reduction in their pay gaps.\n\nSex segregation in the workplace is slowly decreasing Year Sex Segregation index* 2009 51 2000 52 1990 54 1980 58 *The segregation index gives the share of women (or men) who would have to change jobs in order for the occupational distribution of women and men to be the same, with a value of 0 indicating no segregation and a value of 100 indicating complete segregation. Source: National Bureau of Economic Research\n\nBut although sex segregation has decreased and more women have moved into historically male professions, such as medicine and law, the persistent way that jobs tend to break down along gender lines still has consequences for women of all races. That\u2019s because the fact that certain industries are dominated by men or women \u2014 and that the men\u2019s jobs pay more \u2014 has never just been about what qualifications an individual did or didn\u2019t have, or how tough the job was to do.\n\nFor example, back in the 1970s and early \u201980s, Minnesota did an analysis of how much men and women who worked for the state were paid. Instead of comparing pay between people who did the same jobs \u2014 what a female and male snow plow driver were paid \u2014 the analysis was one of the first in the country to analyze how people were paid when they did comparable jobs which was determined by whether the jobs entailed a similar balance in four factors: skill levels, problem-solving abilities, accountability and pleasant working conditions. So even though a groundskeeper and an administrative secretary do very different tasks, they might have comparable jobs in part because the secretary needs more problem-solving skills, but the groundskeeper faces more unpleasant working conditions. This system allowed researchers to measure the pay gap more fairly by accounting for sex segregation among jobs, and they found that heavily female jobs were paid less than heavily male jobs, even if they were comparable. \u201cYou had librarians being paid less than the guy shoveling streets in the winter,\u201d said Aviva Breen, who was the director for the state\u2019s task force on women\u2019s economic issues during that time.\n\nWomen across the country are still working under the unequal conditions identified in the \u201980s by that Minnesota study \u2014 jobs that are largely done by women still frequently pay less than jobs that are largely done by men. \u201cOne of the most jarring statistics is that we pay men more to watch cars than we pay women to watch children,\u201d said Kevin Miller, senior researcher with the American Association of University Women. \u201cThere\u2019s no social reason why we\u2019d pay more for our cars than our children, but men are doing one job and women are doing the other.\u201d\n\nThis gap points to one of the persistent, but unmeasurable, underlying factors that likely affects women\u2019s pay. Not only are women less likely to get jobs in higher-paying fields as a result of factors like the pressure of societal expectations and employers\u2019 conscious and unconscious discrimination against women (based on their sex, their race, or both), but work that women do is, on the whole, valued less than work that men do. Any efforts to reduce the pay gap further are going to have to grapple with this dynamic \u2014 either by trying to change it or by trying to work around it.\n\nBut experts don\u2019t all agree on the best way to do that. For instance, Martha Burk, a psychologist and national consultant on women\u2019s pay equity, told me that private employers often aren\u2019t tracking how jobs within the company are segregated by sex and what women are paid compared to men. She advocated for solutions that would require companies to be more aware of and open about those differences. The city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, for instance, requires contractors to provide data on sex segregation and pay gaps within their workforce as part of the bidding process, she told me. Burk has worked as a consultant on these requirements and said that multiple companies\u2019 owners have told her they were shocked by the levels of inequality revealed in that analysis and have changed their hiring and management practices because of it.\n\nMeanwhile, Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, argued for policies that would require equal pay for comparable work, which could help reduce pay gaps without necessarily addressing sex segregation. That\u2019s the approach Minnesota took \u2014 after it analyzed its public-sector jobs in the \u201980s, the state passed a law requiring that comparable jobs get the same pay. As a result, the pay gap among people in Minnesota\u2019s county-level government jobs is narrower than the national average. In one county, the pay gap was essentially eliminated entirely.\n\nAnd Claudia Goldin, an economics professor at Harvard, has argued that sex segregation and pay gaps have more to do with personal decisions \u2014 that women are more likely to seek out and take jobs that offer them more flexibility to care for children and other family members. The solutions, she told me, should revolve around encouraging changes in the way companies value different kinds of work, so that as the number of hours someone works go up, their pay goes up at roughly the same rate, rather than at a faster rate. In other words, if someone is working 30 hours a week at a company, they should be making about 75 percent as much as their coworker who works 40 hours a week. In reality, a person working full time often earns significantly more than their part-time counterpart, which means the part-timer is effectively making a lower hourly rate in addition to losing money by working fewer hours. That can leave people who need flexible schedules in a bind, forced to take what amounts to two pay cuts.\n\nGoldin pointed to the pharmaceutical profession as an example of an industry that has moved away from penalizing part-time work. In the past 50 years, pharmacies have become more tolerant of irregular and part-time work, and they\u2019ve increased their proportion of female workers to from 10 percent in 1970 to almost 60 percent in 2010, according to Goldin\u2019s research. Despite the influx of female and part-time workers, which might tend to lower wages, working as a pharmacist is the third-highest-paid occupation in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And Goldin\u2019s calculations suggest the pay gap among pharmacists is less than 10 percent.\n\nWhat connects these disparate solutions for the remaining pay gap is that they all require private companies to change their cultures and management systems, either voluntarily or through legislation. That shifts the emphasis and responsibility for fixing the pay gap, Burk said, from individual women to their employers.\n\nThat\u2019s a harder sell, both politically and practically, and it could partially explain why the pay gap has been closing significantly more slowly since the turn of the century. Women already made a lot of progress on some of the individually controllable factors that contributed to the pay gap when they got more education and went to work in larger numbers. And while those changes led to more equitable pay, they didn\u2019t come close to erasing the pay gap completely, nor did they dismantle the systems that lead employers and society to value the work women do differently from the work men do. Those systems are harder to change and less likely to respond to the kind of bottom-up efforts we\u2019ve seen so far \u2014 and so is the gap in pay these systems leave in their wake.\n\nAdditional reporting by Christine Laskowski.", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-issues-should-democrats-ignore-in-2018/", "published": "2018-04-04T11:01:53", "title": "What Issues Should Democrats Ignore In 2018?", "text": "Welcome to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s weekly politics chat.

So I definitely agree with that receiving a substantial number of points. It\u2019s also naturally tied to \u201cgap between rich and poor,\u201d which should get more points.\n\nnatesilver: First of all, you gave the most points to the vaguest stuff: corruption in government and Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\nclare.malone: They\u2019re all vague, Nate!\n\nmicah: I mean, here was my general thinking: Given the news environment, you need to really hammer something to have it break through. So this list reflects what I think Democrats should hammer, and then I gave some points to a bunch of issues that are more definitional to the Democratic Party. To the party\u2019s brand, that is.\n\nBut, Nate, you need to make an argument about where the points should go! You\u2019re doing exactly what you criticized in that tweet.\n\nnatesilver: They should go to health care and to the Russia investigation \u2014 those are the most obvious ones. Assuming the Russia investigation includes firing the FBI director.\n\nmicah: It does. But so do other categories.\n\nnatesilver: Those two things \u2014 the health care debate and firing James Comey \u2014 are what moved Trump\u2019s approval rating the most so far (down). I think health care needs 20 points, minimum.\n\nmicah: But given that Republicans mostly failed to pass a health care bill, can Democrats really campaign on that?\n\nnatesilver: Democrats have to talk about taxes more than ZERO, certainly \u2014 otherwise that cedes too much ground to Republicans. You\u2019ve already seen the tax bill become more popular (although it\u2019s still slightly unpopular on net) because Democrats have stopped talking about it.\n\nGun control probably needs to receive more than 4 measly points \u2014 it might not help that much with swing voters but will likely be an important way to rally the Democratic base and keep the GOP on its heels.\n\nAlthough it seems to be going better for Trump recently, \u201csituation with North Korea\u201d probably deserves more than 0 points.\n\nclare.malone: And we should clarify that the Russia investigation is separate from \u201csituation with Russia.\u201d\n\nnatesilver: Yeah, I don\u2019t think much attention should be given to the geopolitical situation in Russia.\n\nmicah: So, here\u2019s my argument on Russia: I think Democrats should mostly leave the Russia investigation alone \u2014 better to have special counsel Robert Mueller (a by-the-book Republican) be Trump\u2019s antagonist on that than Chuck Schumer. But they should still try to keep it in the news, and they can do that with a focus on Trump \u201ctaking a soft line\u201d (paywalled) on Russia internationally.\n\nclare.malone: eh\n\nnatesilver: I feel like you\u2019re overthinking this.\n\nmicah: That\u2019s not an argument.\n\nnatesilver: You talk about Trump firing the FBI director \u2014 that\u2019s what you talk about. And he\u2019ll probably fire or pardon other people by the time we get to November.\n\nLike, let\u2019s say Trump fires Mueller \u2014 how many attention points does the Russia investigation get then?\n\nclare.malone: But corruption in the administration is a really great way to play off the behavioral issues (like firing Comey, like tweeting) that plague the Republican Party of Trump.\n\nAnd you can trickle down and say, \u201cLook what a Republican Congress is putting up with in this administration.\u201d\n\nnatesilver: Isn\u2019t corruption pretty priced into voters\u2019 views of Trump already? It doesn\u2019t seem as \u201csexy\u201d as Russia.\n\nclare.malone: But what about Trump\u2019s Cabinet and all its ethical problems? Didn\u2019t he say he would drain the swamp?\n\nnatesilver: Maybe you can sorta make the argument that he didn\u2019t drain the swamp, sure.\n\nmicah: See, I think Trump firing Comey and/or Mueller fits into corruption/behavior.

And I think election reform is a really important issue in the long run electorally for Democrats.\n\nmicah: What\u2019s their message on health care?\n\nnatesilver: That almost the entire Republican Congress voted to repeal (suddenly-now-popular) Obamacare. And that Republicans will try again if they make gains in the Senate, etc. (Which could very well be true, BTW.)\n\nmicah: But they failed.

Republicans, meanwhile, are more like a -7 or a -8 on the generic ballot \u2014 and almost all of those polls are also among registered voters \u2014 depending on when you look.\n\nSo from a very high level, the strategy is probably just to talk about Trump, and the things that most moved the needle on Trump last year were health care and Comey.\n\nAnd then on top of that, talk about some of the things people don\u2019t like about the GOP Congress \u2014 that Republicans are only out for the rich.\n\nThen some gun control and #MetToo because those are important issues to excite the Democratic base.\n\nAnd some stuff about voting rights because that\u2019s a really important issue for Democrats in the long term and is a good way to frame civil rights discussions.\n\nThat\u2019s my strategy.", "author": ["A Fivethirtyeight Chat"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-let-our-readers-practice-international-trade-they-started-a-bunch-of-trade-wars/", "published": "2018-04-03T19:30:57", "title": "We Let Our Readers Practice International Trade. They Started A Bunch Of Trade Wars.", "text": "Why couldn\u2019t we all just get along?\n\nLast week, we published an article on the game theory of international trade and trade wars. The article included an interactive game in which you (yes, you) were elected president and could pick your own foreign economic policy. Your goal was to maximize the payoff for your country. You could be friendly and cooperative, allowing free trade into your country, or you could be unfriendly and betraying, imposing tariffs. You were then matched against a random FiveThirtyEight reader who had their own strategy. If both sides opted for a lot of betrayal, a trade war broke out, and payoffs were diminished for both sides.\n\nAnd man, do you all get cranky the longer you stick around.\n\nAs we write, over 600,000 of these trade games have been played by more than 55,000 hypothetical reader-presidents. At least one reader played 20 times straight and won every time. (Mr. President, was that you?) A handful of readers played over 40 times straight and never won. (Such sweet sorrow.) And one reader played 943 games in a row. (Thanks, and we really hope you\u2019re OK.)\n\nBecause many readers played this game repeatedly, you gave us a little bit of insight into how trading strategies evolve over time. As reader-presidents learned how the game worked and what strategies tended to be successful, they began to favor unfriendliness and vindictiveness. In other words, you turned nasty as you aged.\n\nOver the course of a few games, players tended to become less cooperative (imposing more tariffs overall) and more retaliatory (introducing tariffs of their own in response their opponent\u2019s tariffs). And they became slightly less likely to mimic the behavior of their trading partner. All of this was a recipe for trade wars.\n\nMuch like in our earlier nuclear standoff game, players were aggressive \u2014 possibly to a fault. In 58 percent of the games we analyzed, the winner was worse off than they would have been under free trade.\n\nThis trade game is essentially a repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma \u2014 a workhorse model of game theory that captures the tradeoff between mutually beneficial cooperation and individually beneficial betrayal. If we play a prisoner\u2019s dilemma just once, there\u2019s only one outcome where neither side can do better with a different strategy: both sides defect. Any strategy that reaches this balance is called a Nash equilibrium, and game theorists crave these solutions. In this case, mutual defection leads to equilibrium because there\u2019s no incentive to cooperate when there\u2019s no tomorrow. Even if we play a prisoner\u2019s dilemma a bunch of times, like over the 100 rounds we simulated in our game, defection still qualifies as an equilibrium because both sides know that in the final round, the best strategy will be to defect, as they once again compete in a game with no future. And if you know your opponent will defect in the final round, you can work backward from there to see that there\u2019s no reason to cooperate in the second-to-last round, which means there\u2019s no reason to cooperate in the third-to-last round, and so on.\n\nBut if we play a prisoner\u2019s dilemma many, many (in fact, infinitely many) times, game theory tells us that we might expect mutual cooperation. If we don\u2019t play nice, our opponent could punish us tomorrow and the next day and the next day. And for countries in the real world, there are many days of possible future trade. That\u2019s one hypothesis for why international trade barriers have been reduced since World War II. The real world may have (until recently) found its cooperative equilibrium.\n\nBut Planet FiveThirtyEight is a world apart. Here, apparently, it is a dog-eat-dog world.\n\nRead more: \u201cHow To Win A Trade War\u201d", "author": ["Rachael Dottle", "Oliver Roeder", "Julia Wolfe"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-win-a-trade-war/", "published": "2018-03-28T11:00:24", "title": "How To Win A Trade War", "text": "The tweet came before 6 a.m., as President Trump\u2019s tweets often do. It was early March, and the Trump administration had just announced steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. That did not make China or America\u2019s European allies happy. Last week, after the U.S. imposed tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese goods, it was reported that China would respond with their own tariffs on $3 billion of U.S. goods.\n\nBut Trump has been undeterred. In his tweet, he suggested that concerns about a trade war were overblown. Instead, he said, \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d\n\nWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don\u2019t trade anymore-we win big. It\u2019s easy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018\n\nBut how easy? And how exactly do you win them? (Also, what\u2019s a trade war?)\n\nLet\u2019s find out. You (Yes, you!) have just been elected president of your very own country. Congratulations! Now it\u2019s time to get to work. There is another country out there that has goods you can buy, and you have goods it may want to buy. Your job is to choose your foreign economic policy \u2014 which you\u2019ll do in the little game we\u2019ve prepared for you below.\n\nThe rules go like this: You can cooperate with the other country, allowing the free flow of its goods into your country. Or you can defect, imposing tariffs on the foreign goods. And because you will trade with the same country over and over again, you have to decide whether to stick with a single strategy no matter what or whether to change course in response to your opponent. The other country faces the same choice, but you can\u2019t know in advance what plan they\u2019ve chosen. Free trade helps both countries, generating big windfalls for both sides. But it\u2019s possible for a single country to improve its own situation at the other\u2019s expense \u2014 you both have a selfish incentive to defect, taxing the imports from the other country and helping only yourself. However, if you both defect, you both wind up isolated, cutting yourselves off from the market and reducing earnings on both sides.\n\nSo, give it a try. Another randomly chosen FiveThirtyEight reader will play the part of the other country.\n\nWas there a trade war? Was it good? Did you win it?\n\nTariffs are the weapons of a trade war\n\nThe game you just played took a little game theory \u2014 the formal, mathematical study of strategy \u2014 and retrofitted it to the world of international relations. (Of course, our simulation is extremely simplified, and it runs in a very controlled little world that ignores alliances, trade deals, political histories, other countries, and hundreds of other factors.) Strategy is king in global affairs. \u201cNations dwell in perpetual anarchy, for no central authority imposes limits on the pursuit of sovereign interests,\u201d MIT political scientist Kenneth Oye once wrote. This is a fundamental principle of international relations \u2014 there is no international super-government capable of making countries play nice if they\u2019d rather not. Instead, countries\u2019 own interests and the lawless web of strategic interactions between them determine the state of foreign affairs.\n\nTake, for instance, the humble tariff. Tariffs are a basic tool \u2014 a tax on imported foreign goods \u2014 that can have major implications.\n\nIt may be in a country\u2019s individual interest to impose a tariff, perhaps to protect its companies or to safeguard a domestic industry from foreign competition. The United States, for example, has some experience with leveling steep tariffs, most infamously with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which is thought to have exacerbated the Great Depression. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan was credited with saving Harley-Davidson by placing tariffs on Japanese motorcycles.\n\nWhile there is strong incentive to betray the other country in the short term, playing nice can profit everyone in the long term.\n\nLately, however, American import tariffs have sat at historic lows, and perhaps for good reason: Imposing tariffs can backfire. Hypothetically, a trade war begins when Country A imposes tariffs or other trade barriers on goods from Country B. Country B, understandably annoyed at the restricted market for its goods, retaliates by imposing its own tariffs or barriers on goods from Country A. Country A, never one to be upstaged, increases its tariffs, Country B retaliates again, and so on. This is one of the dangerous ways that self-interests and strategic interactions can play out. Historically, trade wars like this have been fought over goods including bananas, chickens and wheat.\n\nThat tension is international relations writ small: There\u2019s a tradeoff between cooperation (free trade) and betrayal (trade barriers). Trade wars are what happens when there\u2019s a preponderance of betrayal.\n\nThe trader\u2019s dilemma\n\nOne handy model of cooperation and betrayal is the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, which has been a workhorse model of game theory for decades. The game gets its name from an old story that captures the important strategic elements of the setup: Two criminal suspects are arrested for a major crime and placed in separate, isolated interrogation rooms. The police don\u2019t yet have the evidence they need to convict either individual for the major crime, so they offer each suspect a deal. Each prisoner can decide to defect and betray the other (testifying to the police that the other committed the crime) or to cooperate with the other (remaining silent). If they both cooperate, the police don\u2019t have much to go on and each suspect receives a short sentence for a minor, related crime. If they both betray the other, each receives a medium-length sentence for the major crime. And if one betrays the other while the other cooperates, the betrayer goes free as a reward and the silent suspect receives a lengthy sentence.\n\nIf the pair is viewed as a collective, the suspects are best off if they both remain silent \u2014 their combined total sentence is minimized. But viewed as individuals, no matter what their sequestered counterpart is up to, each suspect has an incentive to betray the other \u2014 and no incentive whatsoever to cooperate. If you and I are playing this game and you\u2019re cooperating, I\u2019m better off defecting, because then I\u2019ll go free while you rot in jail. If you\u2019re betraying me, then I\u2019m better off if I betray you too, because then I\u2019ll get a medium-length sentence instead of the maximum. No matter what you do, I\u2019m better off betraying you. (I\u2019d apologize, but the same is true for you.) Our collective and individual interests are at odds. So it is with trade \u2014 if we\u2019re only concerned about today.\n\nBut what if we knew that we were going to play this game against each other over and over again \u2014 100 times, 1,000 times, even an infinite number of times? Does that change the calculus? The U.S. and China will presumably both be around and trading with each other for a very long time, after all.\n\nTrump\u2019s bizarre statements, lies and saber rattling make any finely tuned game-theory analysis untenable.\n\nA repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma is precisely the game you played at the beginning of this article, and it\u2019s a better analogue for the situation that two real-world countries face. Countries can choose to trade today \u2014 and they can also choose to trade tomorrow and the next day and the day after that. This repetition could offer incentives for cooperation. While there is strong incentive to betray the other country in the short term, playing nice can profit everyone in the long term. As you may have experienced while playing the game above, living in a world where you and your counterpart each cooperate forever is far more profitable than one where you and your counterpart each defect forever.\n\nIn the 1980s, Robert Axelrod, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, organized a series of repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma tournaments, similar to the game in this article. Participants submitted strategies, much like you did, by describing them with a computer program. Every submitted strategy was then pitted against every other and the payoffs were tallied. The winner of the inaugural tournament was a simple strategy named \u201ctit for tat,\u201d in which a player begins by cooperating, and then mimics whatever her opponent did on his previous turn for the rest of the game. (You can play this strategy yourself in the game above. It\u2019s called \u201cThe Copycat.\u201d) As long as everyone plays nice, well \u2026 everyone plays nice. Indeed, Axelrod\u2019s analyses wound up in a hopeful place for cooperation. He wrote in a paper analyzing his tournament: \u201cThe discovery of subtle reasons for the individualistic pragmatist to be nice, forgiving, and optimistic is an unexpected bonus.\u201d\n\nThe real world, of course, is not a prisoner\u2019s dilemma tournament or a FiveThirtyEight interactive feature. There are many more than two countries, and their choices are influenced by hidden agendas, existing trade agreements, domestic political considerations, the relative size of tariffs, the countless different types of goods and services being traded, and on and on.\n\nAnd in the U.S., the \u201cplayer\u201d in charge is sui generis. Trump is individualistic, sure, but it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019s a pragmatist in the game theory sense. His bizarre statements, lies and saber rattling make any finely tuned game-theory analysis of his actions untenable. And, on top of all that, it\u2019s possible that Trump is playing his own trade game, a different game entirely from ours \u2014 one where the value of cooperation is unrecognized. In our game, two countries cooperating can generate profits for both. Trump may see the world differently.\n\n\u201cHe would argue that it\u2019s a zero-sum world and that there is no mutual interest to be realized,\u201d Oye, the political scientist, told FiveThirtyEight. \u201cFor Trump, there are winners and there are losers.\u201d\n\nFor a game theorist, it\u2019s more complicated than that.", "author": ["Rachael Dottle", "Oliver Roeder", "Julia Wolfe"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/student-loans-are-too-expensive-to-forgive/", "published": "2018-03-27T14:00:22", "title": "Student Loans Are Too Expensive To Forgive", "text": "Late last year, graduate students watched as legislators in the House debated giving them a hefty new tax bill: A version of the GOP tax plan proposed to treat tuition waivers as taxable income. Although that plan was later dropped, Congress is once again considering legislation that could affect graduate students\u2019 bottom lines. And the federal government is considering ending some of its student loan forgiveness programs, which could raise the economic barrier to entering certain public service professions and leave social workers, teachers and other people in public-service fields that require graduate degrees paying thousands of dollars more for their education.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Education Department and its inspector general, as well as lawmakers and think tanks of all ideological stripes, have raised concerns about the growing cost of the federal government\u2019s student loan programs \u2014 specifically its loan forgiveness options for graduate students. Members of both chambers of Congress have said they are committed to passing new higher education legislation this year that will include changes to these programs.\n\nThe costs of the suite of plans currently offered by the government to lessen the burden of grad school debt has ballooned faster than anticipated, and the federal government stands to lose bundles of money. A new audit from the Department of Education\u2019s inspector general found that between fiscal years 2011 and 2015, the cost of programs that allow student borrowers to repay their federal loans at a rate proportional to their income shot up from $1.4 billion to $11.5 billion. Back in 2007, when many such programs launched, the Congressional Budget Office projected they would cost just $4 billion over the 10 years ending in 2017.\n\nThe cost of the loan forgiveness programs exploded, in part, because policymakers did not correctly estimate the number of students who would take advantage of such programs, according to higher education scholar Jason Delisle. Now there\u2019s an emerging consensus that some programs should be reined in, but ideas on how much and in what ways vary by party affiliation. Senate Democrats just introduced a college affordability bill that focuses on creating \u201cdebt-free\u201d college plans by giving federal matching funds to states that, in turn, would figure out ways to help students pay for school. In the past, President Barack Obama acknowledged the need to require borrowers to repay more of their debts and made some proposals for modifying the programs\u2019 rules. The GOP goes much further in its suggestions: A new proposal from House Republicans would eliminate some loan-forgiveness programs entirely.\n\nThe federal government currently offers several types of loans, with varying repayment terms, one of which can cover up to the full cost of a student\u2019s graduate program. If, after they leave school, a borrower signs up for an income-driven repayment plan, they will pay back their loan at the rate of 10 percent of their discretionary income each year, and the remaining balance will be forgiven after 20 years.\n\nUnder the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, however, a student\u2019s debt can be forgiven after just 10 years. The program was created to ease economic barriers to entering public service, which is defined as work for any federal, state, local or tribal agency, or any tax-exempt nonprofit.\n\nRight now, a Georgetown Law grad who\u2019s gunning for a job at a U.S. attorney\u2019s office and enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program would expect that the federal student loans she took out to help pay her $180,000 tuition will be forgiven after 10 years. If, like the typical lawyer, she graduates with $140,000 in federal student loan debt and her salary rises from $59,000 to $121,000 a year over her first 10 years on the job, she could have the government wipe out $147,000 in debt \u2014 the full remaining principal of her debt plus interest \u2014 according to a 2014 study from the think tank New America, which Delisle co-authored.\n\nOr let\u2019s say a second-grade teacher with a master\u2019s degree and $42,000 in federal student loan debt (a typical amount for a first-year teacher after undergraduate and graduate school) earns in the 75th percentile for his age for 10 years. If he dutifully fulfills all the requirements for a federal debt forgiveness program \u2014 including completing all of the onerous paperwork \u2014 he, for now, stands to have about $33,000 of that debt forgiven, according to the New America report.\n\nBut this year the House is poised to consider the PROSPER Act, which would, among other things, reinstate a cap on how much graduate students could borrow (up to $28,500 per year, or $150,000 total) and shrink the number of income-based repayment programs currently available for both grad and undergrad students from five to just one, though a traditional, non-income-based repayment plan will also be available.\n\nExperts say the borrowing cap is unlikely to be a problem for graduate STEM and medical students, since Ph.D.s are often funded by grants and tuition waivers. But graduate students who are enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program are far more likely to borrow significant sums. A presentation by the Department of Education revealed that nearly 30 percent of all students enrolled in such programs borrowed more than $100,000, with a median debt over $60,000. If the House plan becomes law, students would likely have to go to the private loan market to finance their education, said Seton Hall University higher education professor Robert Kelchen.\n\nEnding the option of having student loans forgiven also removes a bargaining chip for graduate programs that have a reputation for supporting public service careers, like Georgetown University\u2019s Law Center. Dean of admissions Andy Cornblatt says the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, among others, helps the school attract the best candidates.\n\n\u201cEveryone in legal education is scared to death that some of these federal programs could go down the drain,\u201d Cornblatt says. \u201cEverybody wants to make sure that the ability to attract these kids is not compromised\u201d because of proposals like the PROSPER Act.\n\nSo, let\u2019s return to our hypothetical Georgetown Law grad, the would-be attorney who wants to go into public-sector law and is enrolled in the loan forgiveness program. If the PROSPER Act passes, rather than paying 10 percent of her discretionary income for 10 years and having $147,000 in federal student loan debt forgiven, she would have to choose from one of the two repayment plans it allows. That means she\u2019d either pay 15 percent of her discretionary income until she\u2019s paid off as much as she would have under a 10-year plan, with some of the interest potentially forgiven, or she would have to use a standard 10-year repayment plan, also with no loan forgiveness involved.\n\nIt\u2019s a bleaker picture for a social worker \u2014 who likely needs a master\u2019s in social work to practice and typically starts with an annual income of $24,000, earning $57,000 annually by year 10, according to the New America report. If that social worker is enrolled in one of the currently available income-based repayment programs, all of his remaining federal loan debt (typically $49,000 upon graduation) can be forgiven. Including interest, that would be around $51,000 \u2014 more than the original loan \u2014 even though he would have repaid about $15,000 over the years.

Each year, Americans of all stripes underpay the IRS by hundreds of billions, aided by the fact that the agency lacks the resources to catch all the cheaters.\n\nRecently, tax dodging has found a new champion: liberal state governments fighting back against the Republicans\u2019 far-reaching tax reforms, which seem to hit a number of blue states particularly hard. New Jersey and California want to reclassify certain state and local taxes as tax-exempt charitable donations, while New York might swap the state\u2019s income tax for a deductible payroll tax, among other ideas under consideration. There\u2019s little doubt about the underlying goal of these potential changes, nicely summarized by Connecticut\u2019s state revenue commissioner when he called his state\u2019s plan a \u201cbit of payback for what I think was the utter disregard of the Congress for the impact of this on states like Connecticut.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, for their part, have long blessed other ways of avoiding paying taxes. When Hillary Clinton challenged then-candidate Donald Trump during the first presidential debate for not paying income taxes, he responded: \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d And by cutting funding for audits and enforcement, his party has made it easier for people and companies to fudge their returns.\n\nThe bipartisan flirtation with avoiding taxes, through both legal and illegal means, threatens a tax system that is already bringing in historically low levels of revenue and that pays for everything from social security to military preparedness. Three foes in particular are enabling tax dodgers, making their ploys more common and more damaging: reduced support for the IRS, new incentives for people to become cheaters and widening partisan distrust.\n\nFoe No. 1: A weakened IRS\n\nThere may be no purer example of D.C. dysfunction than the effort to underfund the IRS. That\u2019s because the IRS isn\u2019t like other agencies; when you cut its funding, you actually lose money.\n\nEvery dollar devoted to the IRS budget generates four to five dollars in new revenue, according to statements and congressional testimony from former IRS chief John Koskinen. That\u2019s because a portion of each dollar goes to paying auditors, updating computer tracking systems and otherwise expanding the agency\u2019s ability to collect unreported money from taxpayers.\n\nWhile this argument may sound self-serving coming from the head of the IRS, recent history seems to confirm Koskinen\u2019s view. IRS funding has been cut substantially in recent years, from over $13 billion in 2010 to roughly $11 billion in 2016. And those cuts have set off a chain reaction of underenforcement and undercollection \u2014 including a 30 percent cut in \u201ckey enforcement occupations,\u201d which has translated into fewer audits.\n\nSpecifically, that $2.2 billion funding cut between 2010 and 2016 coincided with an $8.6 billion decline in revenue from audits and investigations.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this figure may actually understate the real losses because audits also have spillover effects. After being audited, tax filers tend to change their behavior, increasing compliance to avoid future investigations, according to a study conducted in Denmark. Recent research has also found that when businesses are visited directly by the IRS, other firms who use the same tax preparer also pay slightly more in taxes. With fewer IRS agents taking to the field, these indirect benefits don\u2019t accrue.\n\nFoe No. 2: Small businesses cheat, and tax reform fosters them\n\nTax evasion isn\u2019t for everyone. Salaried workers who get regular paychecks and a W-2 form have fewer opportunities for it. The IRS simply knows too much about their pay, having gotten regular updates from their employer \u2014 not to mention regular payments via withholding.\n\nInstead, the biggest cheaters are the ones for whom it\u2019s easiest. And that tends to be on the business side, with an outsize role for smaller and less bureaucratic outfits \u2014 particularly small shops with single owners, self-employed freelance consultants and other independent contractors.\n\nIn these businesses (whose owners are generally referred to as \u201csole proprietors\u201d or \u201cnonfarm proprietors\u201d), the people earning the income are the same ones who decide what information to share with the IRS. There is no third party \u2014 an employer or investment manager \u2014 to pass those details along in a non-self-interested way. And while the owner-workers are still expected to report every dollar they get from clients, along with a fair accounting of appropriate deductions, that doesn\u2019t always happen.\n\nThe effect can be dramatic. The IRS regularly performs a \u201ctax gap\u201d analysis \u2014 comparing tax filings against census and other third-party data to estimate underreported and missing income. In 2008-2010, the most recent period for which the IRS has published this analysis, nonfarm proprietors underreported their taxable incomes by an average of 64 percent. And while they accounted for around 15 percent of all individual income tax returns, they were responsible for nearly 30 percent of all underreported dollars.\n\nThe biggest tax evaders are those with the least oversight Estimated underreported taxable income* by income type, 2008-10 Amount of third-party information Income type Share of tax liabilities misreported Little or none Farm income 71% \u2013 Nonfarm proprietor income 64 \u2013 Rents and royalties 62 \u2013 Other income 49 \u2013 Form 4797 income 42 \u2013 Some Capital gains 27 \u2013 Partnership, S-corp, etc. 16 \u2013 Substantial Taxable Social Security benefits 19 \u2013 State income tax refunds 13 \u2013 Dividend income 7 \u2013 Unemployment compensation 6 \u2013 Pensions and annuities 4 \u2013 Interest income 3 \u2013 Wages, salaries, tips 1 \u2013 * Net misreported amount divided by the sum of the absolute values of the amounts that should have\n\nbeen reported. Source: IRS\n\nLooking ahead, there\u2019s reason to fear that the new tax bill will only make the situation worse. Among its key provisions is a sizable tax break for these sole proprietorships and other so-called \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses (non-corporate businesses whose profits are distributed among owners and recorded as a form of personal income).\n\nThis tax advantage functions as a kind of incentive, encouraging more people to file as sole proprietors in order to claim the new deduction. That in of itself is entirely legal, and in some cases could spur entrepreneurship as people jump at the lower-cost chance to start their own small businesses. But it would also mean more people moving from the well-regulated world of paystubs to the tax-evasion-rich world of self-reporting, providing easier paths to tax cheating for more people. Some workers could even use creative accounting to pretend that they are independent contractors in order to take advantage of such opportunities.\n\nFoe No. 3: Partisanship\n\nNorms matter, too, when it comes to tax evasion. Comparative studies of different tax systems have found that people are more likely to pay when they have faith in their government \u2014 and the overall fairness of its tax system.\n\nThis is a two-part problem for the United States. First, residents don\u2019t have much faith in the U.S. government: Polls show that levels of trust hover around 20 percent, close to historic lows. Second, rising partisanship makes this trust problem harder to solve, because it means that whoever takes office will face opposition from a stalwart and sizable population of distrusting voters loyal to the other party.\n\nThe U.S. tax system hangs in the balance. A recent working paper from a team of university and government economists found that tax evasion is indeed wired \u2014 like a light switch \u2014 to the partisan outcome of presidential elections. The results suggest that when George W. Bush claimed the presidency in 2000, people in heavily Republican counties became more tax-compliant and suddenly started revealing more of their income to the IRS; ditto for heavily Democratic counties after Barack Obama\u2019s election.\n\nAnd what was the source of this extra income, hidden from view until a friendly president assumed the Oval Office? Using proprietary data from the IRS, the researchers were able to show that more income was suddenly reported from those same under-inspected sources, including sole proprietors and other pass-through businesses.\n\nAlso, while you might expect these swings between Democratic and Republican tax evasion to balance out over time, that\u2019s not guaranteed. If polarization continues to increase, it could be that each election produces a new level of evasion as ever more people on each side look to hide income from presidents they distrust.\n\nOne crucial piece of information is still missing in all this: How much are people currently concealing, year in and year out? The IRS makes that calculation as part of its \u201ctax gap\u201d reports, but that means that the most recent data, from 2008-2010, reflects a time when funding cuts were only beginning and the new Republican tax bill was barely a glimmer in the eye of current House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nEven in 2008-2010, the share of taxable income being secreted from view was at its highest level since the mid-1980s, at 18.3 percent, although the IRS attributes part of this increase to technical changes in how it creates its estimates. Only the IRS knows for sure whether people have continued to hide more money from tax collectors since then, but apart from a few preliminary calls from legislators for extra funding to help the IRS oversee the latest tax reform package, there has been no effort to stop it. Quite the contrary, the foes of tax compliance have only gathered strength.", "author": ["Evan Horowitz"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tariffs-and-bank-regulations-are-splitting-both-parties-in-the-lead-up-to-the-midterms/", "published": "2018-03-15T15:30:48", "title": "Tariffs And Bank Regulations Are Splitting Both Parties In The Lead-Up To The Midterms", "text": "We think of today\u2019s Washington as being rigidly divided along party lines on nearly every issue. But a bloc of Democrats in the Senate just joined with Republicans and the Trump administration on a bill that would lighten some restrictions on banks imposed by the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law, one of President Obama\u2019s signature policy achievements. Meanwhile, some congressional Republicans are considering legislation that would stop President Trump\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which several Democrats and labor leaders have publicly supported.\n\nBipartisanship? What is going on here? First, on policy, it\u2019s clear that the economic issue divides within the two parties that were exposed in 2015 and 2016 remain unresolved, as both the Democratic and Republican parties have establishment wings clashing with populist blocs. Second, I suspect that some Democrats running for re-election in more conservative-leaning states are looking for ways to make their public profiles less liberal by aligning with some of Trump\u2019s positions.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the policy. On the biggest issues of 2017 (health care and taxes), Trump basically abandoned the populism of his presidential campaign and signed on to traditionally conservative bills. Democrats, even ones in red states, felt no need to back these bills since they did not reflect their priorities and were unpopular with the public. No Democrat in the House or the Senate voted for either the tax policy overhaul or the GOP\u2019s various measures to repeal Obamacare.\n\nBut the unity within the two parties and the clear divide between them in 2017 should not make us completely forget about 2015-2016. In those years, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was casting the Obama administration as too friendly to Wall Street, and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was making a similar case against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primaries. On the GOP side, Trump was proposing new tariffs, opposing international trade deals and generally talking up more protectionist, \u201cnationalist\u201d stands; establishment-oriented presidential candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio sharply criticized one of Trump\u2019s tariff ideas and embraced trade agreements that Trump opposed.\n\nIt seems like the energy and passion of the Democratic grass roots is now on the left, echoing the more populist visions of Sanders and Warren. So I am a bit surprised both by the size of the bloc of Senate Democrats who voted to roll back some of Dodd-Frank (16 Democratic senators and one Democratic-leaning independent joined Republicans \u2014 more than a third of the Senate Democratic caucus) and by the individual members from more liberal states who joined this effort, like Virginia\u2019s Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. But I was not surprised by the reaction of Warren, who has suggested that her Democratic colleagues who backed this bill are tools of Wall Street and that they will be partly responsible if there is another stock market crash and taxpayers bail out the large banks again.\n\nThe embrace of this bill by those 17 members of the Senate Democratic caucus suggests that the populist wing of the Democratic Party has not completely taken over. The Democrats backing the bill argue that this is simply a readjustment of the measure\u2019s language to get rid of some of its unintended consequences \u2014 they feel that the Dodd-Frank rules were meant to apply to the biggest banks in the country but are currently hitting too many smaller banks. (A key provision that the Senate is considering stipulates that only banks with more than $250 billion in assets would be considered \u201csystemically important financial institutions\u201d and therefore subject to a number of provisions in Dodd-Frank targeting the largest banks. Under current law, that oversight applies to banks with more than $50 billion in assets.)\n\nBut it\u2019s easy to see this dispute as a manifestation of the tug-of-war going on between more liberal and more centrist Democrats. The 10 Senate Democrats with the lowest Trump Scores (FiveThirtyEight\u2019s measure of how often they vote with the Trump administration) all opposed this legislation. The 10 Senate Democrats who vote most with the Trump administration all backed this bill.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, the split on tariffs is even sharper: One man (Trump) stands against the Republican Party establishment. Before Trump formally announced the tariffs, which are expected to go into effect this month and are designed to lift the U.S. steel and aluminum industries, a group of 107 House Republicans signed on to a letter expressing concerns about them. In contrast, there is really no organized effort in the broader Republican Party or on the Hill to defend the tariffs. The president had the power to implement his policy anyway, but he does not appear to have persuaded the rest of the GOP leadership to move in a different direction on trade.\n\nTariffs do have their supporters, though \u2014 among the opposition. Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia were among those who spoke positively about them, along with Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO, a coalition of unions across the U.S. Brown in particular has long warned about the dangers of international trade for American workers. On trade policy, Trump is simply more aligned with Democrats in the Rust Belt than Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nAnd here\u2019s where we come to politics. What if the reshuffling of the party lines on Dodd-Frank and tariffs is all about the midterms? Seven of the 10 Democrats running for re-election this year in states Trump won in 2016 support the Dodd-Frank rollback. Brown and Casey, who are among that 10, don\u2019t support that legislation \u2014 but aligning with Trump on tariffs could help their prospects, since these members may need some Trump voters who liked his rhetoric on economic issues in 2016 to back them this fall.\n\nSimilarly, opposing tariffs and supporting a rollback of Dodd-Frank, which are the positions of most congressional Republicans, align perfectly with the views of the Koch brothers and other big-money donors who will be critical to Republicans keeping control of Congress. Backing Trump\u2019s protectionist policies could help GOP candidates with the party base, which strongly supports both the president and tariffs, but donations and support from the GOP\u2019s establishment donors may be even more valuable. (We should note that backing a rollback of Dodd-Frank could help Democrats get more money from the financial community, too.)\n\nWhile these political considerations matter, I think there is at root a real ideological split within the two parties on economic issues. If Trump continues to take more protectionist positions, that is going to force the Republican Party to either move toward his views or use congressional authority to stop him. It\u2019s not clear if Sanders or Warren or both will run for the 2020 Democratic nomination, but the broader issue of how opposed to big banks and Wall Street the party should be will surely factor into the next presidential party primary.", "author": ["Perry Bacon Jr."]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-tariffs-could-actually-work-if-he-has-a-plan/", "published": "2018-03-13T09:58:43", "title": "Tariffs Can Work \u2014 When They\u2019re Part Of A Plan", "text": "Republicans are in revolt. Economists on the left and right are deeply skeptical. President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser resigned rather than be party to it. The culprit: tariffs, and specifically the president\u2019s decision to slap duties on imported steel (25 percent) and aluminum (10 percent).\n\nThough they are widely vilified, tariffs actually can work, providing protection for a few vulnerable companies, safeguarding entire industries, maybe even encouraging a wholesale reassessment of what counts as fair trade. Tariffs also come with considerable costs and risks, however, and making the gambit work requires a well-defined goal and a winning strategy. And it\u2019s not clear that Trump has the detailed plan needed to make this gamble pay off.\n\nOne early estimate of Trump\u2019s plans, for example, uses a variant of a well-respected model to project that the tariffs would eliminate five jobs for every one they save, because the help they offer steel producers is more than offset by the elevated prices that users of manufactured steel, like car manufacturers, wind up having to pay. This is often a risk with tariffs: By raising the price of imported goods, tariffs strain the budgets of companies \u2014 and consumers \u2014 who buy those goods. In addition, tariffs can provoke an escalating trade war in which foreign countries who resent the new border tax fight back by implementing protectionist measures of their own.\n\nBut these risks don\u2019t mean tariffs are doomed to fail; they just require a long-term goal that justifies the short-term cost in jobs and dollars \u2014 and a way to reach it.\n\nThis kind of targeted tariff helped save Harley Davidson, for example. In the early 1980s, the company was losing market share to smaller, more affordable imports from Japan. Bankruptcy seemed a real possibility until President Ronald Reagan agreed to introduce a severe protective tariff.\n\nDeliberately designed to be fast-acting and short-lived, the tariff started at a steep 49.4 percent before gradually falling back to the normal 4.4 percent rate over the course five years. In the end, it didn\u2019t take that long for Harley Davidson to reorganize its operations, fix manufacturing problems and return to profitability. By year four, they felt secure enough that they actually asked for the tariffs to be lifted early (presumably because the tax had already fallen dramatically and because a show of strength was good PR).\n\nTo some observers, that turnaround might still count as a failure because the company recovered not on its own but with the help of regulations that, by their very nature, interfere with the free market, limiting consumer choices and putting upward pressure on prices. But clearly the tariffs accomplished their basic goal, blunting competition from Japan in order to give an iconic U.S. company breathing room to catch up.\n\nNow consider a broader example of tariffs in action, namely the heavily protectionist world of European agriculture. The EU operates under an integrated set of policies designed to ensure a decent standard of living for Europe\u2019s farmers while also guaranteeing a reliable supply of food for European citizens. Among those policies are direct payments to farmers, funding for rural development \u2014 and also tariffs, including some tariffs that bite deeply into the pockets of U.S. farmers. When sending goods to Europe, American farmers face an average tariff of 13.7 percent, or nearly three times what E.U. farmers face when exporting their products to the U.S.\n\nAll this special treatment for native agriculture comes at a serious cost, of course: Over a third of the E.U. budget goes to support the roughly 5 percent of citizens involved in farming, which is money that can\u2019t be used for other urban or industrial priorities. But what really matters is whether Europeans think these costs are outweighed by the benefits that come with tariffs and other agricultural supports. And in a recent Eurobarometer poll, 52 percent of respondents said they \u201ctotally agree\u201d or \u201ctend to agree\u201d that the EU should have trade barriers for agricultural products, compared to 34 percent who disagreed.\n\nWhich brings us back to Trump\u2019s decision to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports from outside North America and a 10 percent levy on aluminum. Here, too, the defining question shouldn\u2019t be, \u201cWhat will it cost?\u201d but rather, \u201cWhat\u2019s the underlying goal, and can it be achieved at a reasonable cost?\u201d\n\nThe chosen goal might be quite narrow, along the lines Trump himself outlined when he signed the tariff proclamations last Thursday: \u201cA strong steel and aluminum industry are vital to our national security.\u201d Ensuring that the U.S. can produce enough steel to keep building planes and ships in the event of a military emergency seems like a tailored and well-defined objective, not unlike the aim of the tightly targeted Harley Davidson tariff.\n\nBut narrow efforts aren\u2019t always the most successful. The last time the U.S. imposed steel tariffs in an attempt to bolster the industry, under President George W. Bush, the real-world effects proved rather meager. Imports did decline, but seven U.S. steel companies still went bankrupt and the number of workers in the industry seems to have dropped. Partly, this may be because the tariffs didn\u2019t last long enough to allow for the kind of restructuring that U.S. steel mills really needed; they were lifted within two years, after the World Trade Organization ruled them illegal. But it\u2019s also possible the industry needed more help than tariffs alone could provide as a result of high pension costs and a history of inadequate investment.\n\nWith the virtue of hindsight, it seems like the time was ripe during Bush\u2019s presidency to pursue a bigger goal: not just helping America\u2019s struggling steel industry but helping many U.S. industries fight off the full force of what\u2019s sometimes called the \u201cChina shock\u201d \u2014 the sudden rise in Chinese imports of all kinds after the country joined the WTO and gained broader access to U.S. markets. Between 2000 and 2007, America lost about a million manufacturing jobs, affecting industries well beyond steel. A more ambitious plan \u2014 one that included steel tariffs alongside other protections and supports \u2014 might have helped defend U.S. industries across the board.\n\nTrump may indeed have something bolder in mind, in which case steel and aluminum tariffs may merely be the opening move. At times, he seems ready to embrace a widening trade war, saying that if Europe retaliates against the steel imports, the U.S. could impose a new tax on EU cars. And during his campaign, he floated the far more disruptive possibility of a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports.\n\nBut if the goal is indeed grander \u2014 a realignment in global trade that opens space for more U.S. exports and U.S. manufacturing jobs \u2014 then tariffs alone probably won\u2019t suffice. Remember that to build a unified agricultural support system, the EU created a complex package of tariffs, subsidies, regulations and rural development aid that all operate in concert.\n\nTo ignite a renaissance of U.S. manufacturing, a lot of other things would have to change: The dollar would probably need to fall further, which would help spur exports; countries like China and Germany would have to start saving less and spending more, thus creating more demand for foreign goods, including those made in America; and the U.S. would likely have to pare back its own appetite for imports, including getting Americans to save more money.\n\nWhatever the objective, it needs to be paired with the appropriate tactics. For some goals, tariffs make sense, even if they do come with costs. Ultimately, the only way to assess Trump\u2019s tariff plans is not with a ledger comparing the boon for steel producers against the cost for steel users, but by identifying the broader goal \u2014 and seeing whether it gets met.", "author": ["Evan Horowitz"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-position-on-iran-shows-how-much-harder-north-korea-will-be/", "published": "2018-03-12T10:00:24", "title": "Trump Is In A Worse Position With North Korea Than Obama Was At The Start Of The Iran Talks", "text": "President Trump boldly announced last week that he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to talk disarmament, working to fulfill his recent State of the Union promise to prevent Pyongyang from obtaining nuclear missiles that could hit the U.S. homeland. In making that pledge, Trump declared, \u201cI will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Trump has been relentless in criticizing predecessor Barack Obama not only for failing to defuse the North Korea threat, but also for the nuclear disarmament deal he did succeed in striking \u2014 the agreement with Iran. Calling that pact fundamentally flawed and unenforceable, Trump indicated that his standards for non-proliferation agreements are exceptionally high. (He still hasn\u2019t spelled out clearly what \u201cdenuclearizing\u201d Pyongyang \u2014 the Trump administration\u2019s stated goal \u2014 would look like).\n\nThe contrast between the Trump administration\u2019s approaches to North Korea and Iran indicates how difficult it will be for the president to fulfill his promise regarding Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 Trump so far has put himself in a worse bargaining position with North Korea than Obama was at the start of the Iran talks, and the challenge in North Korea is even greater.\n\nObama was in a better position with Iran\n\nAfter several months of secret contacts between U.S. and Iranian officials, Obama signed off on the start of a formal negotiation process in November 2013. He entered those talks with several advantages over Trump\u2019s current situation; in particular, Obama had secured an interim agreement in which Tehran promised to freeze its nuclear progress, meaning that it couldn\u2019t use the talks simply to buy more time as it tried to obtain a nuclear weapon.\n\nTrump has no such commitment. While Kim allegedly offered to halt nuclear and missile tests this week while negotiating with the Americans, he made no pledge to stop the work that precipitated the current crisis: miniaturizing a nuclear warhead and fitting it atop an missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. And North Korea has dragged out negotiation processes in the past.\n\nObama was in a better position with the world\n\nThe main reason that Iran came to the negotiating table in 2013 is that the world had unified behind a far-reaching international sanctions campaign targeting Tehran over its nuclear work. Led by the U.S. but brokered through the United Nations, there was near-universal agreement that it was essential that Iran be kept from getting the bomb, even at the price of hurting domestic economies. The result was sanctions that caused Iran real pain.\n\nIn addition, five world powers (the other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council \u2014 the U.K., France, Russia and China \u2014 and Germany) had come together with the U.S. to conduct the negotiations, meaning that Iran couldn\u2019t play countries off one another and any agreement signed had much greater heft.\n\nThough North Korea is under tight international sanctions and has a decimated economy, the biggest economy in the world \u2014 and the one country that is a lifeline for Pyongyang \u2014 hasn\u2019t ever signed onto the U.S. strategy: China. Trump said during the campaign that his game plan for taking on the North Korean regime would be to enlist Beijing, but while he has made some progress in that direction, there is far from a unified vision between the two powers about how to treat North Korea.\n\nObama was in a better position with his administration\n\nThe U.S. had laid years of groundwork before entering into talks with Iran. Well before Obama took office, the George W. Bush administration started the sanctions regime that ultimately proved critical. Washington had accumulated experience on how best to target sanctions; how to assess Iran\u2019s behavior in talks; and where they were most likely to find common ground.\n\nObama also had the full support of his Cabinet \u2014 necessary for a negotiation that requires the tireless diplomatic efforts of a secretary of state, the scientific expertise of an energy secretary, the sanctions enforcement of a Treasury secretary and the muscle of a defense secretary. Each step of the process was overseen by the entirety of the National Security Council.\n\nTrump, in contrast, reportedly made a snap decision to meet with Kim and didn\u2019t so much as consult with his National Security Council. It was \u201ca decision the president took himself,\u201d Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said plainly on Friday, mere hours after telling journalists traveling with him in Africa that direct negotiations were far down the line. Tillerson \u2014 who is nominally leading efforts to engage the North diplomatically \u2014 seems to have found out about the summit around the same time as the rest of us.\n\nThen there are the many ways that the North Korea situation is a tougher nuclear nut to crack than Iran\u2019s missile program. That might be part of the reason that it was the top unfinished crisis item that Obama left on Trump\u2019s desk, warning on his way out that it would be the new president\u2019s greatest challenge.\n\nNorth Korea has a stronger nuclear position than Iran\n\nIran did not already have nuclear weapons during those 2013-2015 negotiations. But North Korea does. Tehran was still in the process of producing highly enriched uranium usable for nuclear weapons and was only on the threshold of a nuclear weapons capacity when the interim deal froze the program.\n\nPyongyang already has up to 60 warheads, according to U.S. intelligence community assessments. At this point, the Koreans are simply perfecting their delivery vehicle, an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching any part of the U.S..\n\nPut simply: The more advanced the program, the more embedded it is in a nation\u2019s military and national security strategy, the more spread out its infrastructure is across the country, the more difficult it\u2019s going to be to detect, monitor and dismantle. And on all of these scores, Pyongyang is far beyond where Tehran ever was.\n\nNorth Korea has a better ability to hide its activities\n\nOne of the central pillars of the Iran deal is the requirement for constant monitoring of Tehran\u2019s declared nuclear-related sites and expedited access for inspectors to other sites upon request. This is meant to cover Iran\u2019s entire nuclear fuel cycle \u2014 or, in the words of skeptical Western diplomats, the \u201cchain of evidence\u201d of their nuclear activity \u2014 from start to finish, including its uranium mines and mills and enrichment and storage facilities. Meanwhile, the North Korean technology in contention \u2014 building ICBMs \u2014 is a matter of quiet and undetectable military research and development. Kim\u2019s government could be working in laboratories the U.S. never knows about.\n\nFurthermore, the U.N.\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency is allowed to inspect only areas to which it has either been invited or where a nation has agreed to cede oversight control. Bet world powers would not know where to begin negotiating for access in North Korea, because it has no real grasp on where all the nuclear-related facilities are hidden. In other words, U.S. intelligence has extremely low confidence in where those 60-odd warheads are \u2014 if that\u2019s the right number.\n\nIn addition, all of North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities are de facto military facilities \u2014 a significant barrier to inspections, as nations of all stripes argue it\u2019s a violation of their sovereignty to grant U.N. monitors access to military sites. The IAEA would be dependent on Pyongyang providing an exhaustive list of nuclear facilities, even though it has consistently lied throughout the lives of past agreements.\n\nTrump started out in a weak position on North Korea and now is poised to enter talks from an even poorer posture. His lack of specificity about the terms of denuclearization means that his negotiators must enter high-stakes talks without knowing his own parameters for success. And then there\u2019s Pyongyang\u2019s wager that U.S. military options would be frozen so long as both parties remain at the negotiating table \u2014 raising the risk that North Korea is, once again, buying itself valuable time through talks to advance its nuclear arsenal.\n\nMeanwhile, the president\u2019s hardline position on the Iran deal could affect his negotiating posture with North Korea. At roughly the same time he plans on meeting with Kim, he is threatening to pull out of the Iran accord if the Europeans don\u2019t provide assurances that they are willing to strengthen it \u2014 suggesting that the U.S. cannot be trusted to follow through on its promises across governments, among other messages.\n\nOf course, whether Trump decides to go ahead with the summit under these conditions is far from certain. White House officials are already backpedaling on the president\u2019s firm commitment to the South Koreans that he would sit down with Kim by May.", "author": ["Michael Wilner"]}]}, "nbpostgazette": {"rss": "http://nbpostgazette.com/feed/", "link": "http://http://nbpostgazette.com/", "articles": [{"link": "https://nbpostgazette.com/top-rated-life-simulation-games-for-mobile/", "published": "2020-01-22T03:05:51", "title": "Top Rated Life Simulation Games For Mobile", "text": "If you are interested in Life Simulation Games and are one of those who want to know the best of them, then you are in the right place.

When And Where You Can See It?", "text": "The first full moon of the year, which is popularly known as the wolf moon, is going to shine in the night sky on Friday, January 10.\n\nOn December 26, some of the worlds saw a \u201cring of fire\u201d eclipse of the Sun, and now exactly two weeks after some of it is going to see a \u201cWolf Moon Eclipse\u201d as now the moon drifts into the shadow of the Earth.\n\nAt the same time, a \u201cpenumbral\u201d lunar eclipse is going to be visible in some parts of the world.\n\nWhile people will see the full moon in the U.S., but most of us won\u2019t see the eclipse.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for people in the Americas, the eclipse will take place during the daytime and will be over by the time the moon climbs above the horizon,\u201d AccuWeather meteorologist Brian Lada said.\n\nIt is also going to be visible from Europe, Africa, Asia as well as some other parts of Australia, where observers are going to witness a rather odd-looking full moon on Friday, 10th January 2020 under clear skies, but people of North America won\u2019t be able to observe so.\n\nThe only exclusion is for folks in Alaska as well as in far eastern Atlantic Canada, Brian further said.\n\nWhat is Penumbral Lunar Eclipse?\n\nA penumbral lunar eclipse is a natural phenomenon that occurs when the Earth in course of its orbit around the Sun, comes in the middle of the Moon and Sun in such a manner that Moon is hidden in the shadow cast by Earth. This can only happen when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are accurately or very closely aligned, with Earth in the middle of the other two. A lunar eclipse can take place only on the night of a full moon. The type and length of a lunar eclipse be determined by the Moon\u2019s closeness to either node of its orbit.\n\nThe outer shadow of the Earth blocks part of the rays of the sun from reaching the moon, which then further appears slightly darker than usual.\n\nWhen is January\u2019s full Moon?\n\nThe moon is going to be 100% visible on January 10at exactly 7:21 pm Universal Time, which in EST is 2:21 p.m. and 11:21 a.m. PST. That\u2019s the daylight hours in North and South America, so it is going to be difficult for anybody there to spectate the \u201cWolf Moon Eclipse,\u201d however dusk on Friday is going to be a perfect time to watch the full moon rise in the west close to sunset.\n\nObservers in Asia, Australia, Europe, and Africa are going see a rare a penumbral eclipse of the moon.\n\nWhere to See the \u2018Wolf Moon Eclipse\u2019?\n\nFor those who want to see the full moon at its best, just make sure to look on January 10 at moonset (around sunrise) as well as moonset (around sunset). On the other hand, if you\u2019re in Asia, Australia, Europe or Africa, then you must take note that the penumbral lunar eclipse starts at 5:07 p.m. Universal Time and is going to be at \u201cmaximum eclipse\u201d at 7:10 p.m. Universal Time.\n\nHere is the list of locations and timings on which one can easily spectate \u2018Wolf Moon Eclipse\u2019:\n\nLondon: 7:10 p.m. on January 10\n\n7:10 p.m. on January 10 Mainland Europe: 8:10 p.m. on January 10\n\n8:10 p.m. on January 10 Cairo: 9:10 p.m. on January 10\n\n9:10 p.m. on January 10 Moscow: 10:10 p.m. on January 10\n\n10:10 p.m. on January 10 Dubai: 11:10:02 p.m. on January 10\n\n11:10:02 p.m. on January 10 New Delhi: 12:40 a.m. on January 11\n\n12:40 a.m. on January 11 Shanghai: 3:10 a.m. on January 11\n\n3:10 a.m. on January 11 Perth: 3:10 a.m. on January 11\n\nThere are about 35% of all eclipses that are of the penumbral type, which can be challenging to detect even with the help of the telescope, as per eclipse expert Fred Espenak.\n\nAn additional 30% are partial eclipses, which are easy to see with the unaided eye. The final 35% or so are total eclipses, and these are quite surprising events to look at, Espenak said.", "author": ["Carrie Brunner", "About The Author"]}, {"link": "https://nbpostgazette.com/top-5-mistakes-that-we-all-make-while-using-our-smartphones/", "published": "2020-01-10T05:17:08", "title": "Top 5 Mistakes That We All Make While Using Our Smartphones", "text": "Nowadays, technology is growing so fast that it is being included in our day to day activities that we have become addicted to it. The best example of this would be Smartphones.\n\nThese days, we can\u2019t even think about our lives without smartphones and the addiction to this device is growing so fast that almost everyone around the world is now using this technology.\n\nHowever, smartphones have made our lives and various difficult tasks very easy. But at the same time, while we are so occupied with our phones, we just forget the fact that we are damaging ourselves unknowingly.\n\nWe people take care of our health by going to the gym, exercising, eating healthy food and so on but at the same time we neglect the harmful effects of the smartphones in our lives as well as in our health. Therefore, today we are going to discuss on the same.\n\nIf you are one of those who are searching to get more information regarding the top 5 mistakes that we all make when using our smartphones, then you must read the following article until the end. You are perfectly at the right place as today with the help of this article, we are going to provide you major details regarding the top 5 mistakes that we all make when using our smartphones. So, without wasting any time let\u2019s get started\u2026.\n\nSleeping With Your Phone\n\nThe biggest mistake almost everyone does is to sleep with your phone. One must understand that a cell phone is mainly an electromagnetic transmitter and receiver. This is a simple term that means that it produces or releases radio waves that are not good for health.\n\nEven though it has not been proven yet, but at the same time the research carries on to show how the waves might possibly affect your brain after being exposed for long hours.\n\nTo say at least, we can say that the smartphone can wake you up with notifications for the period of your sleep cycle, thus disturbing your sleep. If in case it\u2019s not possible for you to turn it off completely or keep it in another room while you\u2019re asleep, then simply try keeping it on airplane mode.\n\nLooking At The Screen With Bad Posture\n\nUsing mobile phones can cause thumb injuries like tenosynovitis and in addition to that another health condition called \u201ctext neck\u201d is also a common issue. The name itself suggests, when you bend your neck forward to look at the screen, the stress on your cervical spine increases bit by bit thus giving a bad posture. After that, the weight your neck feels maybe 5 times more than your actual head weight. This further causes health issues such as neck pain as well as posture abnormalities.\n\nUsing It With A Low Signal\n\nWhenever you will see a weak signal on your phone, then you must know that it is actually putting out a stronger signal as a transmitter, along with more energy from your cell phone means more harm to your health. It also causes your phone to heat up which is an additional threat.\n\nClose Contact With Your Skin\n\nMany studies have focused on the fact that close contact of the smartphone to your body might lead to cancer, especially their transmission signal is around 900 MHz. However, there is no definite proof of this but it is said that your skin absorbs the heat easily in tiny bits each time you keep it close to your body.\n\nExposure To Blue Light\n\nThere are many pieces of research that have found that using your smartphone before going to bed makes it harder to fall asleep. The main reason behind is the exposure of blue light for too long as it contributes to sleep issues.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis was our list of top 5 mistakes that we all make while using our smartphones.

The president has all the authority he needs under Article II to respond. How he responds is yet to be determined.\u201d\n\nWhat are ballistic missiles?\n\nWell, a ballistic missile has a ballistic trajectory, in simple words, it means that the missile is powered and guided in the direction of a target, but as its fuel is spent, the missile\u2019s warhead gets separated and it then falls under gravity onto its target.\n\nIn addition to that, Ballistic missiles are made up of mainly three parts and those are a propulsion system, a guidance system as well as the payload, which main aim is to destroy the target.\n\nBallistic missiles are more challenging to intercept as compared to the cruise missiles for the reason that they can be launched rapidly as well as travel at high speeds.\n\nThe payload in a ballistic missile can consist of conventional explosives, biological, chemical or else the nuclear warheads. On the other hand, they are propelled by solid or liquid fuels.\n\nSource: Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance; The Associated Press", "author": ["Carrie Brunner", "About The Author"]}, {"link": "https://nbpostgazette.com/australia-to-shot-and-kill-up-to-10000-camels-amid-australian-wildfires-rage-report/", "published": "2020-01-08T10:03:26", "title": "Australia To Shot And Kill Up to 10,000 Camels Amid Australian Wildfires Rage: Report", "text": "Deadly wildfire in Australia has shaken the whole nation as well as the whole world.

The number might possibly double in the next decade if the population isn\u2019t managed accordingly.", "author": ["Carrie Brunner", "About The Author"]}, {"link": "https://nbpostgazette.com/heres-what-to-know-about-controversial-citizenship-amendment-bill-in-india/", "published": "2020-01-08T05:42:14", "title": "Here\u2019s What to Know About Controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill In India", "text": "India has moved a step closer on Tuesday towards the significant challenge to the country\u2019s secular constitution. Indian lawmakers have now finally passed the Citizenship Amendment Bill through the lower house of Parliament where the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has a huge majority.\n\nThe leading party BJP came to power under the Narendra Modi government in the year 2014 but won a landslide reelection in May with a bigger majority. From that time, the government has embarked on progressively bold moves for reshaping India as per its ideology, sidelining Muslims in the procedure.\n\nCitizenship Amendment Bill\n\nThe Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 which has been passed by the Parliament of India on 11 December 2019, has created lots of rage in India, especially in Muslim communities.\n\nThe reason behind this is that the act amended the Citizenship Act of 1955 by offering a path to Indian citizenship for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, as well as Christian religious minorities that had escaped persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan before December 2014.\n\nAnd Muslims were not given such eligibility in this bill. This was the first time ever and the first act as well where religion had been openly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law.\n\nThe passage of the Act triggered many types of protests as well as criticisms. In the eastern regions of India, the protesters were against the naturalization of any and all refugees or migrants. In some parts of India, political and student activists protested that the law \u201cmarginalizes Muslims, is prejudicial against Muslims\u201d as well as seeking that Muslim migrants along with the refugees should also be granted Indian citizenship according to its secular grounds.\n\nThe leading party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had promised in earlier election manifestos for offering Indian citizenship to persecuted religious minorities from neighboring nations. Under this 2019 amendment, all the migrants who had entered India by 31 December 2014, as well as had suffered \u201creligious persecution or fear of religious persecution\u201d in their country of origin were made eligible for citizenship.\n\nUnder the new act, the Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh as well as from Afghanistan are not offered citizenship. Critics, on the other hand, have questioned the exclusion. The Amendment limits itself to the Muslim-majority neighbors of India as well as, in addition, takes no acquaintance of the persecuted Muslims of those nations. As per to The Economist, if the Indian government was apprehensive about religious persecution, it should have involved Ahmadiyyas \u2013 a Muslim sect who have been \u201cviciously hounded in Pakistan as heretics\u201d, as well as the Hazaras \u2013 another Muslim sect who have been murdered by the Taliban in Afghanistan. They should also be treated as minorities.\n\nCountries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, as well as Bangladesh, are Muslim-majority countries that have modified their Constitutions in recent years in order to declare Islam their official state religion. As a result, as per the Indian government, Muslims in these Islamic nations are \u201cunlikely to face religious persecution\u201d.\n\nOn the other hand, the government states that Muslims cannot be \u201ctreated as persecuted minorities\u201d in these Muslim-majority republics.\n\nIn addition to that, the Act also does not consist of migrants from non-Muslim nations fleeing persecution to India, mainly Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar, Hindu refugees from Sri Lanka, and Buddhist refugees from Tibet, China.\n\nOn the other hand, the amendment also relaxed the residency requirement in order to naturalize these migrants from eleven years to five. Instant recipients of the Bill, as per the Intelligence Bureau of India, are going to be a total of 31,313 refugees, out of which 25,447 are Hindus, 5,807 are Sikhs, 55 Christians, 2 Buddhists, and 2 Parsis.", "author": ["Carrie Brunner", "About The Author"]}, {"link": "https://nbpostgazette.com/golden-globe-awards-here-is-thefull-winners-list/", "published": "2020-01-07T09:29:41", "title": "Golden Globe Awards 2020 Here Is TheFull Winners List", "text": "The 77th Golden Globe Awards 2020 has finally concluded on January 5, 2020.

Why Is World War 3?", "text": "The New Year 2020 has just started but instead of expecting a peaceful year, fears of an upcoming World War III have already been spread all around the world. This news is doing the rounds of social media after the killing of an Iranian soldier by the United States.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Thursday that the US President Donald Trump ordered the killing of Iran Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani, who died in Baghdad \u201cin a decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad,\u201d\n\nThe attack came among tensions with the United States after a New Year\u2019s Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the US Embassy in Baghdad. The two-day embassy attack which ended Wednesday urged Trump for ordering about 750 US soldiers deployed to the Middle East to perform the attack.\n\nWho is Qasem Soleimani and Why was he killed?\n\nQasem Soleimani was an Iranian major general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and, from the year 1998 until his death. He was the commander of its Quds Force, a division primarily who has been responsible for extraterritorial military and clandestine operations.\n\nAfter being unknown in Iran until the year 2003, General Soleimani had turned out to be the most recognizable battlefield commander of Iran, disregarding calls to enter politics but becoming as powerful, if not more, than its civilian leadership.\n\nIn addition to that, Soleimani was also a commander of the combined Iraqi government as well as the Shia militia forces that advanced against ISIL in the years 2014 and 2015. Soleimani was one of the first who supported Kurdish forces fighting ISIL, providing them with arms.\n\nFor Iranians he was the icon since the Islamic Revolution have been stern-faced clergy, General Soleimani extensively signified a figure of national resilience in the face of four decades of US pressure.\n\nFor the US as well as for Israel, he was a shadowy figure in command of Iran\u2019s proxy forces, who is responsible for fighters in Syria backing President Bashar Assad as well as for the deaths of American troops in Iraq.\n\nPreviously this week, after an attack on the US embassy in Iraq, which America has blamed on Iran, the US then launched airstrikes.\n\nThe Pentagon then later confirmed on Friday that US forces conducted an airstrike at Baghdad airport in order to put off \u201cfuture Iranian attack plans\u201d.\n\nSoleimani was then killed in a targeted U.S. drone strike that was held on 3 January 2020 in Baghdad, Iraq. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was the deputy head of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), was also killed in the attack. On the other hand, Soleimani was succeeded as commander of the Quds Force by Esmail Ghaani.\n\nWhy is World War 3?\n\nThe US President, Mr. Trump said the general was \u201cdirectly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of millions of people\u201d.\n\nUnder Soleimani\u2019s leadership, Iran had bolstered Hezbollah in Lebanon and other pro-Iranian militant groups. He had also expanded its military presence in Iraq and Syria as well as orchestrated Syria\u2019s offensive against rebel groups in the nation\u2019s long civil war.\n\nGeneral Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more\u2026but got caught! He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number\u2026. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2020\n\nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on the other hand, said: \u201csevere revenge awaits the criminals\u201d behind the attack. He then also announced three days of national mourning.\n\nThe tension between the two countries increased and the trend for World War Three began as people drew parallels between the death of General Soleimani as well as additional killing that was held 105 years ago.\n\nEven though many people on Twitter speculated about the outbreak of World War Three, the US and Iran are known for their bombast, and it is unclear what revenge, if any, will be extorted.\n\nTweeting again on Friday, Mr. Trump said Soleimani had \u201ckilled or badly wounded thousands of Americans\u2026 and was plotting to kill many more\u201d and \u201cshould have been taken out many years ago\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country,\u201d he said.", "author": ["Carrie Brunner", "About The Author"]}]}, "journalismday": {"rss": "http://journalismday.com/feed/", "link": "http://journalismday.com/", "articles": [{"link": "https://journalismday.com/2018/06/global-pv-junction-box-market-insights-by-2023-ningbo/", "published": "2018-06-01T08:36:04", "title": "Global PV Junction Box Market Insights by 2023: Ningbo ChuangYuan PV Technology Co., Yitong Solar, Sunter and Ltd", "text": "Global PV Junction Box market 2018 research report is a solitary device that gives an inside and out analysis of various PV Junction Box market bits of knowledge, openings, security approaches and political methods for making solid conclusions.
